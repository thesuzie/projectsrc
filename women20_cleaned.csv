3,22286932,"I'm sorry but I don't want to be an Emperor, that's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate;
has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in:
machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little:
More than machinery we need humanity;
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.

Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say ""Do not despair"".

The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress: the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish. . .

Soldiers: don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder.

Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate, only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers: don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.

In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written:
- ""The kingdom of God is within man""
Not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men; in you, the people.

You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let's use that power, let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

Believe it or not, us introverts DO have a drive for a special someone, but it is not paired with your natural drive for human interaction. That being said, your drive for love tends to be about twice as strong as ours.

My feelings on OP is that he should take his own advice and just enjoy life as a bachelor for a little bit. If he does not feel a need for a partner, why make him have one right now? 

Something that we loathe about relationships, is that it is often extremely difficult to get into a successful one based on our psychological wiring. Essentially speaking, women have a tendency to be more people oriented. That being said, it is far more likely for women to possess the cognitive function of Fe. Known as extroverted Feeling as their primary function. 

That being said, if a man is introverted, he is more disposed to having thinking as his primary based on his gender, but if he is introverted, he now has Ti instead of Te as his primary function. It is common for women to posess Fe as their primary, but many men do not have Ti as their primary, but more often than not, Te instead.

When you get the combination of Fe and Ti together, there will always be wars which rage inside. The physical wiring of the two people are anything but compatible. In this case scenario, the one with Fe (usually the female), will become angry at the man for either:

-Not sharing his feelings
-She feels he is emotionally distant
-He is not as outgoing as she likes
-The connection between the two is difficult to establish

In such relationships, the Fe user will always be the one who is angry and who leaves. The Ti user often was happy with the relationship as he feels happy with companionship.

Point of story? If you are like me (and what I suspect OP of), it is difficult to find a girl who does NOT posses Fe as her primary. That being said, relationships ARE pointless to us unless we can find the right person. I did not find out until a week or two into the relationship with my ex that she was an Fe user. My first thoughts were, ""This is going to be interesting.""

My fears came true. Everything that is supposed to happen does, and in addition, we had a few extra issues based on preferences which made matters worse (jealousy + un-trust).

As an Fe, you should learn of different personality types and use it to your advantage (seeing as you are a natural at it anyway).

Just for the record, using Fe as a primary means you focus on the feelings of others and you subconsciously gauge how good people are at certain things. That being said, Fe's tend to make great leaders. A Ti is one who thinks on a very logical level, he is one who builds maps and thinks things through inside his own little world. Many theories play and prove and disprove themselves in that little world. 

A Fe and Ti can work together as partners to be EXTREMELY useful for a job, but they will never quite...connect. One can lead the people (Fe), while the other can think of the best way to get the job done with the people (Ti). The Fe will have to tell the Ti who can do what though.  

Wow...I just made a psychological rant...fun. 

***CITING***[https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?pid=13757758#pid13757758]***CITING***To answer your question, I enjoy the social engineering aspect of hacking so I found myself actively studying psychology and different theories associated with them. This theory is debatable by many psychologists, but it is effective and accurate enough in my eyes for use. As for the extrovert vs. introvert: There are different types of intelligences. An extrovert is more intelligent when dealing with people and feelings while an introvert may be more intelligent with how things operate, work, etc. 

It is all based on what you want to do. An introvert running the country may be a smart move, but the people would never understand his actions, and because of this, they would never vote for him. Just my take on that specific area.","

2. Exactly, men fight (like men.) And get whatever happened off their chests, women just bitch and moan about it for the rest of their life while spreading rumors about people who are probably their friends anyway.

3. Guys cannot just walk through ghettos? Are you joking?? If a white guy such as myself was to walk through a black neighborhood I would be abused, attacked. Hell, perhaps they might even feel like shooting at me. 

4. Don't give me that rape shit, women can prevent it so easily. Don't walk around with your tits out and a mini-skirt above your knees if you don't want men to think suggestively of you.

Also what you said about coding, I doubt that very much;

1.Your grammar is horrible
2.Your a woman, I've never once met a remotely decent female coder

Proof of this coding ability, please.","

You got some good lines in there, but they're all by luck, like rolling a dice.
Nice, your lyrics are typical, about women, you're going to get crabs, that pubic lice,
Fried rice, I'm asian, my lyrics are original and relate to my boring old life.
I'm no G like you may be, I don't walk around with a gun or a knife,
I won't grow up fucking hoes left and right, I'll settle down with a pretty little wife,
I may not deal with the strife you ""gangsters"" constantly do, 
But I sure know how to rhyme, I'd say a little better than you. 

Yay.  "
