-- need to look for posts only in hackforums
-- need to include more words to search on to get more range
-- maybe in total take out 5000 (1000 ildi and me, 200 eliza and segev, 200 ben and dan, 200 rita and alice,

-- only want to take the content and post id

-- to download a file:
-- scp sgw36@shalmaneser6.sec.cl.cam.ac.uk:~/filename /Users/suziewelby/year3/compsci/project

-- for testing matching and doing some cleaning
\copy (select * from "Post" where "Content" like '%woman%' limit 20) TO '~/woman20.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;

-- hackforums has site index 0, case insensitive matching of strings anywhere in post (so plurals and girlfriend should also be matched)
-- got rid of 'her' because it was matching with there etc

-- extraction attempt 1:
select "IdPost", "Content" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(woman|women|she|girl|female|lady|ladies|relationship|gender|pack)' limit 3000

-- extraction attempt 2:
-- limit length to 3000 chars
select "IdPost", "Content" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(woman|women|she|girl|female|lady|ladies|relationship|gender|pack)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 3000

-- extraction attempt 3
-- add white space to matches to get words on their own
select "IdPost", "Content" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(woman|women|\s+she\s+|\s+her\s+|girl|female|lady|ladies|relationship|gender|pack)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 3000

-- extraction attempt 4:
-- removed pack from key word search
select "IdPost", "Content" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(woman|women|\s+she\s+|\s+her\s+|girl|female|lady|ladies|relationship|gender)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 5000

-- extraction 5:
-- for  fist attempt at annotation with additional annotators
\copy (select "IdPost", "Content" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(woman|women|\s+she\s+|\s+her\s+|girl|female|lady|ladies)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 10000) TO '~/tenthousand.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;


-- extraction based on just single keywords:
-- women:
\copy (select "IdPost", "Content" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(woman|women)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 200) TO '~/keyword/women.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
-- bitch:
\copy (select "IdPost", "Content" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(bitch)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 200) TO '~/keyword/bitch.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
-- girl:
\copy (select "IdPost", "Content" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(girl)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 200) TO '~/keyword/girl.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
-- lady:
\copy (select "IdPost", "Content" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(lady|ladies)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 200) TO '~/keyword/lady.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
-- female
\copy (select "IdPost", "Content" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(female)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 200) TO '~/keyword/female.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
-- whore
\copy (select "IdPost", "Content" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(whore)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 200) TO '~/keyword/whore.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;

-- extraction for attempted labelling with new categories
\copy (select "IdPost", "Content", "Thread" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(woman|women|girl|female|lady|ladies)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 10000) TO '~/newsearch.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;

-- improvement on last attempt
-- ladies gave lots of posts like "hi ladies and gentlemen" etc and girl picked up girlfriend mentioned in random stories
\copy (select "IdPost", "Content", "Thread" from "Post" where "Site"=0 and "Content" ~*'(woman|women|girl\s+|girls\s+|female|lady)' and char_length("Content") < 3000 limit 10000) TO '~/rawdataset.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
