4011,59411798,6048125,"Namely Walmart. I've gotta be honest, starting a week ago, I've been stealing from the Walmart my girl works at. Haven't told her or anyone else. Thought I'd start doing it cuz I'll probably need the extra cash selling the stuff to make rent and other bills, and I really don't wanna ask my family for any money.

So how do you guys do it? Methods you've used? What stores? Do you have any friends that help? What happened when you got caught?

What I've noticed lately is at this Walmart, lots of items in the Clearance isle are pretty cheap; lots of tags are only $1. What I'll do is just look for an item with a loose tag, or one where one tag has been placed on top of another, so that they peel off in one piece. Then you just put the tag on an expensive, but inconspicuous, item of your choosing and check it out. So far I've managed to nab a few gaming mice and keyboards from the electronics. A couple of times the store wasn't so busy, so I'd scan about 5 other items before the expensive one, so that the name of some wrong item wouldn't be visible on the screen in case an attendant came by for any reason. At busy hours, though, they're usually tending to other customers, and I can get away with just bagging the item quickly. This is at a self-checkout btw, the only way this would work.

At this Walmart, the employees at the store usually don't ask to scan your receipt when what you've bought fits in a grocery bag, but for anything outside of one, they ask. During early and late hours of the day, however, there's no one there to check, so I wonder if I could make it out of the store with appliances and bigger boxes and stuff like that.

i dont have anything against u but this guy aint epstein 
u didnt state his age, 
if hes some Clay Davis like 25 30 40 50 60 then yea this is pretty fugged and he could get in trouble with law 
but if hes 18/19 then thats basically an average relationship, do u think 15/16 yos dont have sex?

do state his age so the situation is clearer 

plus: you say you're friends on discord and the girl is from denmark, if they had sex then they're both from denmark, right? are you in denmark too? do u know where he lives (roughly, like city)?
it would be a lot easier if you knew him in real life and lived near him

the only way you can get him in legal trouble is a police report in his local area
(which you cant do without enough information about him, so if u only know his username then not much to do)
IF you have all the information then file it stating that bla bla bla sexual thing with minor
the most important thing is the nudes on his phone, if the police gives a Clay Davis about your police report, and cares enough to go check him out, check his phone out
if nudes are found then boom u have revenge

Having sex with a minor,

I thought this guy was my friend, I tried to stop the relationship because he's getting fugged and is being manipulated by her anyway but still giving a 15yo a £500 laptop is fugging not normal.

Laziness is a contribution towards NOT having enough to do/having too much to do so naturally you're pulled to doing nothing as it's been what you're used to or whats easier.
The second is what most people are and its willfully lazy, its a matter of just doing it and you'll realize you either like to do it or  its easier than you thought.

Best way to combat it? Get a woman dog, women are life savers, seriously.  They're like a swiss army knife, its like magic having a women there to tell you to do things or help you with stuff.  They're a calendar, watch, alarm pretty much every physical application crammed into a body. 

The harder way to combat it? Do it.  It sounds stupid but as an example, I hated brushing my teeth for the longest time until I started dipping and even then I hated doing it every night for some reason.  Eventually I just started doing it randomly  every night and eventually its become a thing where I just do it off hand without even thinking of it.

I've seen videos at Instagram promoting TikTok, but what I saw yesterday did hurt my Soul.

A young teen, dancing halve naked with the captions (popping up and fading away)
> Dancing first
> ""Guys checking me out"" (She shows her way to revealing shorts from her back-side)
> ""Me; I'm only 14"" (turns around facing camera with a sexy look  😊 )
> *Acts like guys being scared off*
> Video repeats

This hurts my Soul.. they're complaining about being chased by Pedophiles, while acting like a whore online.
NO, I'm not saying that pedophiles have any reasons to do what they do, but I wouldn't flash my a$$ at some gay-parkinglot-meetup place and later post a video how gay people looked sexually at me. I hate it! 

They used to make fun of 'funny' things when I was a kid. We danced, played and went outside 'exploring'.
These days it's all about pulling a duckface, forcing your lips to be bigger than they are, walking like you got a big ass while almost folding your body in halve bending your back way to worse and all and I mean they all act like they have 1,000,000 followers and being paid thousands each day to post some brand, while they complain to their parents day and night just to get spoiled.

I feel really sorry for all the ladies out there or girls growing up that feel the 'need' to act like a whore in order to get attention or some kind of recognition. We're being dumbed down in a satanic-normalisation world that doesn't know the difference anymore between making love or being f*cked. Just my 5 cents thoughts though.

She was either influenced or just horny, so she decided to get herself some booty call. After her work shift she changed her mind and didn't want to tell you, so she just ignores you. She is the one who ignored you, so she doesn't expect you to ignore her after.
Anyway, she's not interested, else she would come over. A girl came one time from 3:45 till 7:00 and she agreed with leaving before 7:30 as she only wanted some fun. 

Just find yourself a girl or a woman that is more mature or more serious with you, or at least a girl that keeps her 'appointments' with you.

The fun part is, that because it's tinder, you can just swipe right a couple of times and you'll get another catch right away. Wouldn't get too attached to girls you meet there anyway. I've met the craziest girls using Tinder. Some of them had just broken up with their ex hours ago, others stuffed with depression and others looking for nothing more than a quick ego boost.

Honestly, if you wanted to just have sex with someone, you could have gone for a stroll in town. There's always someone someone looking for a one night stand kinda thing.

It's not worth keeping her in your mind either, because she clearly demonstrated how she has no plans on following through. Or maybe her reasoning went something along the lines of 'I don't want to get an STD or be called a slut', which is absolutely fine. She might have just enjoyed the talks you were having.

If youre good with budgeting i'd say go for and tell her in a nice way, that youre ready to move to the next stage in life and get your own pad. Maybe ask if she would help you find one or if she will double check to make sure its a good deal. Let her be involved in it and itll be alot better for the both of you plus itll make your mother happy aswell.
   If you cant move out whatever the reason may be, She needs you to help around her house. your brothers rely on you for transportation. Whatever the case, I'd sit down with your mother and just talk to her on a personal level. And mention youre not hanging out with the family less out of spite or to be malicious. Youre just wanting to be more social and active outside while your brothers are into video games. So its not bad just you guys enjoy different things. And remind her whenever they do want to go out and do something youll be happy to. Just til then you dont want to wait and want to be active with friends.

When I moved out it wasn't really in good grounds.

I moved in a house with a girl and my mom didnt want me to
it didnt work out and didnt last long so I came back home.

My mom made my room a crafts room and had to stay on the couch
she wanted a lot of money for rent $100 a week but that averages about 400 a month
I felt like I was running in circles I left with nothing man went a few months with out even having a tv
it was still worth it eventually my mom came and gave me my tv and my xbox and my cloaths it might sound hard brother

Dead honest bro one day I found a studio apartment for only $300 a month
after I took that apartment I had so many differnt girls at my place it was like my life really started.
I was only there for a year then got a better job and a better house but it wasn't bad living at all.
I would eat ramen and hot dogs for days straight but the freedom made it so worth it.

4134,59611019,6063372,"This is how you have to see it. Coming from a person who's main source of income involves the movement of large quantities of herb, and also being in lock down due to my main IRL source of income, you gotta put money and family over everything in order to cope with drug addiction. This is my personal view. SWIM moves around 7-8 lbs on a good day and is living comfortably during lockdown. SWIM smokes A LOT of bud. Up to around a zip a day of spliffs, Adderall, Klonopin, and Promethazine with Codeine are also dailies to be added to this list. 

The thing is, I was lucky enough to be plugged into a small circle of people and have other skills set aside that I do to make an income online and in real life. You need to have money and a consistent source of high volumes of it in order to consume large amounts of drugs recreationally. It's as simple as that. If you do not, then don't bother. You will bankrupt yourself eventually because of your habit. 

Money management and substance abuse (whether or not you want to call it an addiction or not), can be easily managed if you are in the right position. This is coming from someone who had a terrible addiction to Fentanyl in 2016 and overdosed 5 times. On the 5th go around, I put down any hard drug around me, cut off all ties to people involved in stuff that would lead me back there, and began to start saving money again.

Now in your case, I would recommend a complete and SELF detox. Don't buy into rehabilitation bullsnap via impatient care. That's all a money making machine. Independence from drugs comes from the heart. There's many things you can do though. I actually do know how this is and how this may feel. I myself, cannot play a video game or truly enjoy life without being medicated anymore, having money, or a pretty girl on my side. This is co-dependency. But again, my point being, I am lucky enough to live comfortably. 

Tips for you to quit:
-Throw away anything you have; including paraphernalia. Just do it. It's a trigger.
-Music is fantastic but be careful in the choosing. Some genres are a huge trigger for some people.
-Prioritize money. This is what I did and still do. 
-Remove people from your life that might lead you back to smoking. Sad, but very true unless they compromise.
-Run 30 minutes a day, eat 3-5 healthy meals a day, and engage yourself in some sort of educational activity. Books, brain games, even Hack Forums. Running will release endorphins important to keep the brain healthy. Your diet will provide you with the energy needed to feel better mentally. Books will help distract you, and brain games will actually help you regardless of if you are a drug user or not. 
-Consider an Antidepressant (I am highly against this btw).

I am no doctor, but hopefully I helped a little.

During these times I've done some regrettable things because I was so torn from reality I literally thought I could do anything and it would not affect my ""normal"" life. I danced naked in front of friends to an Eminem song, don't ask why, for some reason I thought the song had exponential meaning to the part of my trip that I was in. I also have just walked around my house throwing sheit on the ground and my sons mother was picking it up right behind me. I've straight pissed in the bed because I, literally, and I mean this in the most crazy sense, didn't think I had any ties with real life. I was completely tore out the frame all of these times. I did this when my ex fiancee was pregnant with my son and I remember asking her if my son was okay because for some god awful reason I was under the impression that I did something to hurt him.

I've read almost every Murakami book and my favorite is Kafka on the Shore by far and it was the first one I read, but 1Q84 is definitely safer.

tl;dr: +1 on this rec and here's a list of my favs that are good to start with and have a decent narrative

there are many ways besides selling a product in ewhoring that can make you money but yea its cringy if you think about it

but its mostly kids that are try hards or spam everywhere that make ewhoring such a bad rep. It can be a secure source of income if you plan everything well

   
I don't work the same way as most people in the ewhoring sector do

most kids hop on kik or snapchat, farm traffic from places where everyone is just looking for a hot chick trying to get a free nude or 2. Some also have a kink for anoying girls online

So Three years ago today i was released from Prison , aftrer spending half a year inside.
I was only 19 at the time and first time id ever had a run in with the police. The justice system does not work in the favor of a young black male.. Caused my own demise. I was going through depression for the first time in my life , and i had committed multiple failed painkiller overdoses . I had broken up with the girl i wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I was not attending school anymore. I had a poor relationship with my family, because i kept everything from them. I was just completely lost. 

Fast forward to today, i've never had another run-in with the police since release. I've completed my probation. I'm currently undertaking an Engineering degree at university. My relatioship with my family is good. I've been on 4 holidays, got my own car, got a weekend job and i'm seeing this girl. 

I really , really hand on heart wouldn't in my wildest dreams believe or even think id be here today. All Praise be to God! Pray hard man .. God was my therapy for my anxiety and the rest of it. It puts ALL the problems of the world onto the Creator. He's the Best of Planners.

I know that moving location can sometimes help a person and I moved to a big city after 15 years in a small one. I finally decided to settle and have a girlfriend but it is a struggle for me. My woman has preexisting conditions such as adhd and abandonment issues since she was adopted. I love her and try to understand but sometimes it is beyond me. My girlfriend has multiple disorders that are undiagnosed but I can say the same for me. I suffer from extreme anxiety and depression and I really am happy with her but I'm so scared. She lacks impulse control and that has lead to many disasters. I wholeheartedly want to help her and love her and we talk to her psychologist often.

4204,59432715,6049681,"When I stopped watching porn it was probably one of the best decisions I made. It lowered my anxiety to the point where I only get it if I’m about to do something that any rational person would get anxiety from. Not from literally anything. Made me confident, motivated, ect ect the list goes for days. Everything they say about quitting porn is true. (This is for people that don’t have a lot or any sex. If you have a girlfriend or are sexually active, then porn probably isn’t bad for you.) Speaking of which, I went to a strip club for the first time. Got probably the hottest girl there to give me a cheap dance and she was implying that we, ‘go to the back rooms’. Me, being a dumbass, slightly drunk, virgin idiot decided to not do that because when I finally have sex I want it to be with someone special.. like a smoking hot stripper isn’t special. I’m glad I didn’t spend the money on it, but I should’ve definitely wish I indulged.
Anyway, I got some blue balls from the experience, and I’ve played some pocket pool ever since. But I don’t watch Porn anymore, ever. Lately I’ve been looking at pictures of some of the girls I used to watch when I watched Porn everyday. It’s getting harder and harder to not click on a video. I’m sure one time would be fine, but I’m still not wanting to do it. It’s honestly probably one of the worst addictions I’ve ever had.

or was this woman just being an asshat and playing off the pitbull stigma?


anyone who knows pitbull better could probably help me out alot here.

The governor of the Lombardy Region Attilio Fontana said that there were 89 cases in his region, most of which had popped up in small towns in the countryside.

Almost all of Italy’s cases are clustered in the north, with roughly a dozen towns on lockdown meaning that people are not allowed to enter or leave the towns’ boundaries.

After Lombardy, the next hardest-hit region is Veneto, in the northeast, with at least 17 cases.Sports events in the affected northern areas, including local kids sports team practices to three Serie A (top major league) soccer matches, were canceled.  ",0,0

First of all, i do not know much about this specific girl who made the challenge and i am not saying what she specifically deserves, i am merely conveying general Islamic beliefs and rulings.

IF you truly believe in Allah and His Messenger, then you can not distinguish between Allah and His Speech, and the laws that His Messenger conveyed to the people. Islam is at its foundation a personal faith and its main goal is exactly that, but Islam also comes with rulings and regulations in every aspect of our lives, whether it be social, economic, or political spheres.

Every country has laws and regulations, and an action which will cause corruption and havoc, then the government intervenes to ""control"" the people like you mentioned, i don't understand why you see it differently when it comes to Islam, since like I said every country has a government who tries to control the peoples behavior and prevent mischief.

Allah decided that whoever mocks Him and His Messenger, then they will not receive any of His Mercy rather Hell will be their abode.

""And if you ask them, they will surely say, ""We were only conversing and playing."" Say, ""Is it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?

If God 'punishes' us why do humans intervene and think they know what God decided? Do you think the girl is going to learn anything about the religion if she is threatened to death by the people who worship Allah?

That's why I think you and other should not intervene and do ANY judgments. Because Allah is great and will show her the right path. But you and other people think that you understand God so good that you want to take matters in your own hands and punish her.

Religion is a personal matter. You make it like it affects the whole community but that isn't the case you are afraid that others will speak up and you know that when that happens you will have no control. Allah is great, he already made the path, if thinks happens that's because he decides that it will.

I see him as understanding, not someone who gets angry because you make a joke.
Or get irritated because you don't understand a certain subject. That is something that humans do not a deity.
Allah doesn't punish, he teaches. Buddhism calls it karma. 

Also, you state that you find what that women did a mockery meanwhile here in Netherland there are people who really mock religion (not only Islam), and their intent is to mislead people.

This woman seemed to try to participate in a religious thing while being an atheist. 
You should understand that it's pretty hard for that person to understand the language of the world.
But it's a journey none the less. Allah will show Himself to her when it's time.
But people intervene, they harass her, make death threats, make her scared to do anything again with Islam.

Qur'an 4:34—Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women).

Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction,
    happy is the one who repays you
    according to what you have done to us.
 Happy is the one who seizes your infants
    and dashes them against the rocks.

 Numbers 31:17-18 is also a merciful 

Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately. But all the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves.

Stoning isn't exclusive to Islam either.
Deuteronomy 21:18-21

If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.

You also quoted from  Sahih al-Bukhari 2658—The Prophet said: “Isn’t the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man?” The women said: “Yes.” He said: “This is because of the deficiency of a woman’s mind.”
 If you are unbiased you'd come to understand that it is easy to fool women. No matter how much you defend them, two or three words might lead them to believe your lies. Furthermore, the women witness is half to that of Men because at that time women used to stay at home so they don't know anything about what's happening that's why it was their witness half to that of Men.",0,0

Please research when, where, and why the scientific method was invented, this would littterally answer your own question.  I will remain having faith in a higher intellectual being, whether it be within our own universe, within another universe, or outside of the universes, atleast until the day scientists can prove to me the origin of the first molecules, and or the first particles, but I personally believe the current scientific explanation of the origin of our universe is a bunch of bs. God is the starting point, and unless they can prove their theory, then it is just as a unbelieveable as you might find religion.

   
An all powerful being has to be able to sin as well, but not necessarily be a sinner. The power that comes with being a God litterally means no restrictions, but God decides for god-self if god wants to be good or bad, just as you could do harmful & good stuff wtih your knowledge.

My relatives were the ones claiming it was a miracle and the work of god, sorry if I wasn't clear but regardless you need to calm down. 

Here is the process:
1. diagnosed with late stage Fallopian tube cancer a few months ago (I said 6mo earlier but I don't think thats correct now, definitely between 3-4mo ago)
2. begins chemo treatments, completes 3/8 treatments
3. my family (I was not there) visits her on her deathbed and says final goodbyes, expecting it to be the end
4. she regains her ability to walk after being bedridden for a long time, her body seems healthier 
5. she falls and breaks her hip last week, rushed to the ER where they run tests and find no sign of cancer
6. doctors unable to explain it, they were dumbfounded as described by my grandpa
7. my mormon family members say its a miracle, their prayers truly worked (I dont believe them at all, it is obviously a misdiagnosis or something the doctors missed from the start)
8. here I am writing this reply to your asinine line of questioning

that people of African descent average lower on

Asians, he was excoriated by the mass media and
elements of the scientific elite and forced to retire
from his position as Chair of the Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory  .

I´ve actually thought myself about why Africa has made zero cultural achievements. As someone said before, Africans typically have a much lower IQ score than both whites and African-Americans. I don´t think you can blame this just on the lack of education. I would say that many of the native North Americans developed rich cultures just in speech in a way that Africans have not. Very few explorers who actually lived with North American natives described them as unintelligent. Those who went to Africa nearly always did. As another example, the Mongols became the most advanced war machine in the world despite being uneducated illiterates. Despite what many think the Mongols were usually vastly outnumbered but still achieved victory due to superior military strategy.

However I still don´t want to explain this in terms of racial biology. I think there may be some truth in Australian linguist Gordon Childe´s theory from the early 20th century about sophisticated language being required to express sophisticated thoughts. Notably he was one of few outspoken anti-racists of this time. Many new world tounges were equally or more advanced than English, and so is Mongolian.

1. You're saying we do not live in infinity, this is scientifically wrong. If you believe in science only, you believe everything is created from energy, which some would call matter. Therefore, your argument contradicts itself.

2. To believe in science only, you must believe in infinite matter, that self-generates, and therefore causes the expansion of the universe. If you do not believe in this, you can't believe in anything, including your own existence.

3. I believe in 1 God, and I have proved why this argument is valid from my earlier post. The evidence for pattern recognition within specific acts have scientific backup. Whether or not you want to believe in the scientific backup, seems a bit pointless, as you just argued for not believing in your own existence within my first reply. 

4. It does create more energy. Take a look at something such as farms, we feed the animals, we plant the seeds, and then the energy moves around as you stated yourself, which in the end will result into more matter. What did I just prove to you from the enthalpy of formation? 

5. I am not speaking for god, I am speaking on behalf of my beliefs, which all have scientific backup. God's word is already pre-defined, as I mentioned earlier, and you would have to agree on this whether you believe in a god or not, as infinity means all possible outcomes are pre-defined.

6. My points for this can be proven from earlier, if we are able to follow god's word, still contribute to the cyclus of energy, and be good to each other, without harming the psychology, or physical presence of other human beings, then I would argue for this being the logical solution? Even modern societies have implemented such frames, although it was implemented way before. Right now you are arguing for why rape should be allowed in modern society, can you not see how ridiculous this is? It would spark up a major revolution by women, and in the end, what would the outcome be?

7. Energy as in matter. How many animals would be extinct due to geographical changes, if we as humans did not save them? There are even specific verses about this. One must take a loss, in order to gain, whether it be directly or indirectly. We as humans contribute quite a lot for the breeding process of animals as well, and the energy created, is far superior to the energy we consume. If you do not believe in this, you wouldn't believe in the expansion of the universe.",0,0

Well no, because if you interchange words you remove meaning. Replacing men with white people, and women with black people, is like replacing cupboards with cheese, and houses with shoes. It just doesn't make sense.

Your own personal experiences are meaningless and bias. You should draw opinions and core beliefs from a combination of undeniable facts and experience, not just experience.

If someone is making life harder for someone unknowingly, they don't know they're doing it, so how do you propose they notice? Most people are educated on the current state of our society, it's pretty basic information. People aren't making it easier for men because they're sexist, they're making it easier for themselves because that's business. They go in, and they try and get as far as possible in their career, as smart and concisely as possible.

Some women are great managers, largely due to their ability to multitask. But statistically and biologically speaking, the majority characteristics of women are not beneficial to high level business positions, such as high levels of empathy. Some businesses must fire people, people with families, they need to be able to say no.. routinely, they need to aggressively bargain and make deals, and build leverage over competitors. All these things can't be done with kindness.

If a kind person, male or female, goes up against a not so kind person in high level business, the not so kind person will come off better every single time.

To say business today is sexist, you must prove that if you included all major socio-cultural and biological factors, sexual disadvantage would still be seen. Which has not been shown.... Ever. If there is one thing I stand by its a fugging meta-analysis or 10.",0,0

This is the majority of women that even the feminists ignore (instead they want to focus on celebrities, models, sex workers and basically entertainers, because that's what gets the clicks/views and $$$).

MGTOW isn't better. MGTOW is a reaction to feminism. It's basically feminism for men because it uses the same simplistic way of explaining society and culture. It selects a few stories from the news, focuses exclusively on them to give a definite answer on the question ""who has it easier, men or women?"". Makes men think that they are a minority, that they are second class citizens. That's the same thing feminism does to women. This is exactly the same thing as feminism. I guess in this era people are too lazy to dig deeper and read actual philosophy, instead they want to be fed from twitter and youtube. 

In fact, feminism is better because it is a result of how women are raised. Women are raised to be peaceful, conflict avoiders so you can expect them to form feminist movements that are all about their own safety and not pay much attention to the broader picture.

Men are raised to be the opposite, hard workers that bring results even if they require conflict. They are meant to make hard decisions. The gender stereotypes exist and even those that want to go against them will fail because their core personality traits are defined by gender.

We see now movements like MGTOW, which are basically men that want to be treated like women. They don't want to risk their lives the same way older generations of men did. Or to be alert about potential dangers. They want to date a hot psychopath and then blame her for giving them STDs. They don't want to be decision makers, leaders or patriarchs anymore, they just want to be adult kids in safe environments. That's not manly.

In my experience of life, women tend to be better managers etc, because they don't have such an ego.

If the majority of people in the working society are males, of course the working society is going to be inherently biased to men. Men are going to make it easier for men, not because we're sexist, but because we're making it easier for ourselves, which just happens to profit dominantly male characteristics.

The most successful women in the world are those who adopted male characteristics, or who have appealed the pleasures and desires of men. It's a mans world because men made the world. If women didn't have to give birth to children, and innately have more caring characteristics which just happens to be more advantageous when raising children, then they could do exactly what men do, and would have done what we did.

But they didn't, and this is the world we live in. I will always make my climb as easy for myself as possible, working smart, more so than hard.

Michiru can turn back into her human form and it looks like it is easier to transform than she thought. Or is it? She meets a dolphin beastman, Nina who is the daughter of The Family, the gang involved with the smuggling of medical supplies and such from the last episode.

After discovering that Michiru was a human at one point and after transforming back to her human form, Nina suggests they travel to the human world and go to a party.

At the party, Nina gets so excited that she turns into her natural form, the dolphin. At first, I thought this was where the plot of the episode was going to turn, and something bad was going to happen. It didn't, the people, despite probably being drunk so they couldn't think too clearly, were okay with the fact that she was a dolphin. I think if they weren't drunk or intoxicated with whatever drugs they may have taken at the party, it might be a different story, but who knows. I say this because while in the bathroom, Michiru overhears two girls saying how Nina is scary and that they could never live with someone like that.

The dumbos at the party felt like Nina was tired so they put her in the fish tank. That's the dumbest idea ever. Of course, Nina would have drowned if Michiru didn't transform to help out. Dolphins are mammals! But once again, it's probably because they were drunk and too stupid to realize. Or they are dumb in general. I wanna stick with the latter only for personal reasons but I don't go into that. It didn't tick me off, but it had me questioning their logic. Nina was able to walk on the land no problem, why throw her into the fish tank? I don't know...

Spoiler  (Click to View)  Episode two wasn't a bad one. We get more insight into what Anima City is like. It turns out that the beastmen are shapeshifters and they can turn into their beast form on command. Everyone except for Michiru.

The only complaint I have about this anime is when Michiru's voice actress raises her voice. She's annoying and it kills my ears. I want to punch the hell out of her. Especially at 21:29, she is so annoying.

We get to see a lot of the people we met previously in their human form. We also learn that in Anima City, just like in the wilderness, it's survival of the fittest and only the tough survive. However, despite this rule, it seems there is a police force too.

We learn that Shirou works for the government. His job I guess is like a contractor where he just gets assigned stuff and then helps people by using brute force? Now that we know more about Shirou, he is a total badass, but he is also really cold. I'm sure he will open up in the future. Or maybe not, maybe he'll part ways with Michiru. Because the two are the main characters I feel like the story can go anywhere. Either they work together, or their relationship (which is still new) falls apart.

Furthermore, Michiru learns that not only can she expand her tail but she can expand her arms too. I wonder what other abilities she has. Additionally, we already knew that Shirou can use his smelling ability to a great extent for reconnaissance and much more and I am curious to see what other abilities animals have. I don't believe in real life a tanuki can stretch their bodies like that (to a normal extent, not an exaggeration like Michiru) and it does make sense that Shirou has the ability to have a great sense of smell.

We don't get too much of a cliffhanger so I am wondering what next episode will be like when I watch it tomorrow.

After doing some research in the MAL discussion forums, I took notice of what someone said: ""Are female beastmen (or beastwomen) treated like whores or prostitutes? Is that what Gran Grandma meant by that?""
It seems that women might be treated differently in Anima City. And with Michiru's reaction to what Shirou had to say it was a bit annoying like I mentioned before. She needs to calm down with that yelling voice. There are perfect examples when she's mad and can control that voice, but I'm not digging the whole screaming bits.",0,0

Spoiler  (Click to View)  After watching the second episode I enjoyed it more than the first. It seems this show can do well if it tried. There were funny bits throughout this episode and I think the Hikari vs Riva rivalry isn't anything special but it adds a comedic aspect to the anime that is needed since it can be dry at times.

It looks like the Kibou company needs to make some money. They find out that the old president had donated stuff to a museum so Yutoria and Minato go to the museum to try and get the items back. The lady there says they are allowed to but they have to pay a tax fee. It seems like the tax fee is more than anyone can imagine! So they all join an adventurer contest and whoever wins that contest will be allowed to get the best picks when it comes to jobs.

Minato can ace through the questions that are asked and I think that shows how good and knowledgeable he is when it comes to business. Considering the president isn't support to attack and is supposed to coordinate all the attacks I think that suites his role so well.

Akari and Riva make a bet to see who can clear the dungeon and I think that Kibou company is going to win. I have a good feeling that Minato is going to answer all the questions correct like he has been doing and Akari will carry them with her sword skills.

I think that Yutoria and Guide are fairly useless. I don't think I've seen them do anything worth value. I know that Makoto is a priest and can heal and he did that last episode, but when it comes to using magic, in general, he is useless. Although I said that the action was generic and boring, I do believe if they spiced it up and gave these characters I mentioned some useful abilities, it might change my mind. But just seeing Akari slice-and-dice is just boring and we got enough of that last season with Sally-chan from Bofuri.",0,0
4373,59607425,6064579,"Hello, I don't see a discussion thread on this anime, so I thought I'd create one.




   

This anime is also known as, ""Shachibato! President, It's Time for Battle!"".

 Quote:Shachou, Battle no Jikan Desu! is based on a strategy role-playing game of the same name, set in an alternative world where the player acts as the ""president"" to recruit and train adventurers. The adventurers are then dispatched into dungeons to fight monsters and recover loot. 

You can find more about the anime, here:    




It's highly recommended to keep your posts in spoilers, but there is no way to enforce that since this is a discussion thread and anything goes. Don't get upset if you read something and you aren't up-to-date with the current episodes.

As for me, I shall use spoiler codes for the first three episodes. After that, I will not use the spoiler code anymore.




Spoiler  (Click to View)  There are so many anime this season that is based on a mobile game. This anime is one of them. The story is so generic and bland that you will find yourself very bored. The ratings for this anime are already low and I can agree with the five out of 10 ratings it has right off the start.

The characters don't have any special abilities or anything that really woes you. Each of them has their special ability or purpose in the group, such as Akari being a solider or weapons class and Makoto, her brother, being a priest to heal.

The main character looks like a female and even has a ponytail, but is a male. Hey, there's nothing wrong with that but... Eh. Additionally, we have Makoto who is male but also looks female. Even his attire is female. Akari is a clone of Hatsune Miku and Yutoria reminds me of Hotaru from Dagashi Kashi. I will admit Hotaru has some nice thigh high boots though and her outfit is a bit lewd.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

The art style is okay. Nothing to complain about. The scenery is your typical ""level one area starter point"" that you see in most ""adventure"" anime. What sets this one different is that instead of ""guilds"" companies are hired to take on quests. There is no information on what tasks can be completed other than killing powerful bosses such as Maju.

Note that isn't an isekai but fantasy. It reminds me of ""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"" but not as good.

I don't have high expectations for this anime and it will probably continue to be generic, but I'll continue watching it.

4374,59768670,6060109,"Alright degenerates, if you're a fan of ecchi and fanservice with borderline hentai, you'll love episode six for sure. When watching this anime, I expect the little hints of ecchi we get sometimes from this show, however, today's episode was way more than I expected.

If you aren't a fan of ecchi or fanservice, then you might want to consider dropping the show now as I don't know if it will get as extreme (yes if you think about it this was borderline hentai) as it did this episode in future ones. If you are fine with that, continue reading with my discussion post for episode six.

Well, to start this discussion off it's safe to say that there was barely any plot this episode. Claire and Shuiichi ask someone who goes to their school to let him introduce them to his group that he's a part of. This group is the ones in the photo we saw from the last episode after killing that weird green goblin guy. For those unsure of what I'm talking about, the girl with the helmet, the guy with the camera head, etc.

Ikeuchi, the student that Claire talks to agrees. However, she doesn't say it but maybe she hinted some blackmail herself? We are introduced to Sayaka Koyanagi, the leader of this group shortly after. For all you ecchi lovers, you'll love what you see from her. If only I could post the screenshots for you guys, but I'll let you guys see it for yourself.

To join the pact, everyone has to follow Sayaka to a secluded area. We learn Sayaka is a lesbian and I'm assuming she takes the girls there to have some fun with them, only to tell them that's not the real initiation. The real initiation is that you cannot share any secrets with outsiders. To ensure that, she will wrap a neckless made out of her hair around your neck. This neckless will cut your head off if you betray her or feel like you've betrayed her. While having her fun with Claire, borderline hentai occurs, but it stopped shortly after Claire questioned her motives. Additionally, we see some adult things in Sayaka's room, let's just say, and I've never seen anything like this outside of hentai so I was surprised to see what I saw in an ecchi show.

While all of that is going on, we meet a girl named Chihiro which is the one with the helmet. She tells us how she likes animals and she is obsessed with Shuiichi since he's a dog. She asks him if he can help her find her wallet and eventually he agrees.

Long story short, she goes inside him like Claire. Shuiichi what are you doing! Anyways, I'm guessing Ikeuchi has a little crush on Chihiro since he's so upset she got inside of Shuiichi's suite. Towards the end of the episode, we see that someone in Erena's group found Chihiro's wallet and I already know that Shuiichi and Chihiro will end up finding that group and sh*t will go down.",0,0
4375,59734210,6060109,"Claire and Shuuichi enter the forest to look for the coins. It looks like this forest is a hot spot for coins since a lot of people are going there to claim them. As we learned, gaining coins will grant you power. It seems everyone wants to be stronger or there is something that they want to improve.

We meet some new people in this episode. It looks like the term for those searching the coins is called ""Gatherers"". We meet one of them, Sanbe Tadanori. While meeting him, Shuuichi and Claire fight him. Long story short, they beat him and now he's working together with them to search for the coins.

The fight wasn't anything special, but the dialogue exchanged during the battle was decent. We get to see how Shuuichi and Claire think and work together as a team.

Also, we can see some bonding between the two. We already know that Shuuichi possibly has feelings for Claire. I mean, they've done so much together, but he's a growing boy. Who wouldn't like a girl like that? We also see Claire opening up. Although she's a bit sadistic, we can see her turning slowly into (possibly) a yandere her self, just like her sister. 

In the next episode, it looks like we'll be getting some more action. This time a 3v3 (technically 3v2 when claire's in the suit).",0,0
4376,59662162,6060109,"Episode three.

Spoiler  (Click to View)  My guess for who the mystery girl was is indeed Claire's sister as I thought it would be. It was kind of obvious, and if you couldn't imagine that, yikes. I also suggested that the girl was very yandere like, and we can confirm that Claire's sister is a yandere and will kill anyone to be with Shuuichi. Furthermore, we also learn that it is true she is the reason why he is a monster.

This anime still isn't doing it for me. The fan service is weak which is nice, people are screaming for more and I think that would just ruin the anime. I'm stuck between a five or six rating as I'm not interested in this anime too much. I thought having an ecchi anime this season would be a nice little break from what we've seen last season, and it's not entirely terrible, but what I dislike about this anime is not the ecchi, but the story itself. Not too interesting to me.

Everyone's flipping out how Hanazawa Kana is ""killing"" her role as Erena, but I'm not seeing it either. Call me a negative nancy, it's just how I see things. Is Kana known for being a good yandere voice actress? I checked her page and I notice her from some anime I've seen, but she never left an impact on me to even remember who she was. Edit: I replayed the ending scene, still wasn't impressed.

People are talking about aliens. What are you take on this? Is the guy in the machine handing out the coins an alien?

Before I end my post, I wanted to add did no one notice that the wall in Claire's room was immediately fixed as nothing happened? Also, is Shuuichi living with her now? He seems to be taking real good care of here, especially since he cleans her house and such. Smh, Shuuichi turning into a simp because he's horny.

While Claire was in the suit, she was able to tickle him. However, since it was his hand doing it, how was he laughing? Or is it because she's inside him, her feelings transmit to him as well? Interesting.


I don't have anything positive to say about this episode, so I'll just leave it at that. No one wants to hear me ramble about something I don't like. It's probably because I'm not too into anime like this, especially when all the characters are bat-sh*t crazy.",0,0
4377,59730014,6064475,"For those who ship Haru and Rikuo, this episode will most likely be enjoyable to you. It was very cute seeing Rukuo be a tsundere towards Haru and you can see that she is influencing his everyday life. It's stuck in this love triangle and there is no way out unless he chooses someone to like!

Rikuo ends up getting a second job at some photography studio. We learn later through Haru that he is doing it to save up some money for a present. Maybe Shinako's birthday or something is coming up. Or better yet, maybe he's buying something for Haru. It's very suspenseful not knowing which girl he is crushing over! As you can see though, he's been blushing a lot more with Haru.

We are introduced to a new character named Minato. I don't think we'll be seeing him anymore, but he had a crush on Haru since high school and ends up getting rejected by her. It's nice to see how mature everyone in this anime is. There is no drama, no screaming, none of that pre-teen child-ness we might see in a high school slice-of-life anime.",0,0
4378,59703693,6064475,"Episode four revolves around Shinako and for the most part Rou. I think it's good to change the pace of things. I wouldn't say this anime was 50/50, meaning half liked it and half disliked it, it's hard to say.

There were a few people who dislike it only because they don't like Rou and Shinako as a character. I can understand that, but I have no hate for either of them so my review of this episode will be based on that.

Even though we get a good amount of screentime for both, it's also hard to tell which character got the most out of this episode. We already know that Rou liked Shinako from previous episodes when we were first introduced to him, however, I wouldn't say Shinako's blind, but she probably doesn't realize what she means to Rou.

It was brought up that he might not even truly like her. Rou just had little to no interactions with other girls due to how much time he spent with Shinako. With how weird people are these days, especially when I used to have Snapchat and I'd see stupid stories ""He's old enough to be my dad, but he's my boyfriend!"" type stuff, age might be overlooked here, but in my opinion, Rou should aim for someone closer to his age. It would be interesting if he started to fall for Haru since they have been interacting quite a bit.

It must be nice but weird at the same time for Rou to come home from school and see the girl he likes in his house. I'm sure that makes him happy, but at what cost? I feel like if he keeps this up it's going to ruin him more than anything. He should be focusing on this art course and his future rather than a girl who won't let go of the past.

If you are enjoying this series then this episode will hit you with the ""feels"". The flashbacks of Shinako and Yuu were sad, I'll admit, but nothing to cry about. There were some good references like how the cherry blossom trees were blowing in the wind and you could see the petals. This is Japan resembles death or something, despite being a beautiful sight, I don't know.

4379,59694432,6064278,"This felt slightly like a filler episode, but overall, there was some character development with Arte sprinkled in so I cannot complain.

Arte was able to start her very first job! She's made so much progress. There was, of course, a slight time skip and we didn't go fully into her training, which is okay with me because that would probably take up half the series.

Arte makes a new friend, Veronica. I think that it's good Arte is finally able to make a new friend because now she has someone to talk to about girl things. From what we've seen, she doesn't interact with women that much. We haven't seen him for a bit, but I'm wondering if Angelo is going to make an appearance again. Maybe his sisters can become friends with Arte too.

Arte's little chat with Veronica finally helped Arte realize that she has some sort of feelings for Leo. Do you guys ship them? He is a little bit older, and with how weird the world is today, it's probably not too taboo if they started to date, but I don't think it'll ever come down to it since she's there to work, not date Leo.

It seems this episode was irritating to some. For me, I didn't become upset at all. I guess there was a little bit of feminism mixed with some dark tones regarding prostitution, but that's it.

Spoiler  (Click to View)  Fair episode and the pacing of the anime continues to be good. Not slow and enough to keep you hooked. However, the only complaints I have are the constant, ""You can't do this because you are a girl"" bits that everyone is spouting in this anime. Of course, I am going to let it slide because times were different back then. Women didn't have the freedom they do today, but it's annoying to constantly hear it. We all know Arte is going to woe everyone and show that even though she's a girl, she can do it. If this continues it will be annoying, but otherwise, the show is good.

Still no rating. I'll give it a few more episodes. But I'd say it's around a seven to an eight.

We see that Arte is moving up in the apprentice world. I don't know if time passed, I don't think it fast-forwarded three years but we are at the point where Arte can start drawing a little more.

She worked on her little shed and completely upgraded it to make it her own. I wish they showed us the progress a little more. In a blink of an eye it was complete. I wanted to at least get inside her head to see how she wanted to make it. I think artists have creative minds and they think differently than normal people, so not just the shed I'd like to see a little more into why she does what she does. Everyone has their signature technique and I wanna see what makes her who she is.

We meet Angelo, who well, to put it best is an absolute simp. I hate using that word as much as the next person, especially now that it's overused, but that's exactly what he is and I can't help but laugh.

There are two other girls in the artwork so I'm wondering when we'll meet them. I'm going to take a guess and say that they will be inspired by Arte to do something that ""only men can do"" at the time of the Rennaisance.

Anyways, excited for next episode!",0,0

It's also interesting to see more of Yoshino's abilities as a manager. Seeing how she can come up with solutions to plays, create plays, etc, is awesome and I think it's very funny that she has graphs of the other team's stats as well as graphs for plays they could make.

4382,59688552,6063379,"A drama-filled episode for sure. A very enjoyable one too. Mr. Takarada gets into an accident and Chuuya is given the chance to temporarily run the restaurant. Despite being fired from her job, Minare decided to help out too and it looks like Mr. Takarada doesn't mind it. You don't see much of that over here. If I were to get fired from my job and they were to call me, would I go back and help? Depends. What about you guys?

This episode was more oriented towards the restaurant than it was about the radio job that Minare has. I don't mind it at all. The sister of the person that ran over the person that was going to replace Minare as well as Takarada shows up and says that she is sorry for what her brother did. Traditional, I'd say, but she also offers to work in her brother's place to make up for the trouble that her brother caused.

Tachibana seems very fishy and there is something about her that is off. You can tell that she's trying to hide something but I wonder what it is.

Also, let's chat about the ending scene! What was that about? Chuuya caught her doing something she shouldn't be? Then, he invites her over to his house since she doesn't want to go home?!

Looks like Minare is finally jealous. She ends up getting a call from Mr. Kanetsugu saying that her show is ready to air and she'll be doing a fake story about a woman who murdered someone.

Spoiler  (Click to View)  There is a lot more to this anime that I am missing and there is a lot of things to overlook if you aren't familiar with music. For instance, the Neubaten trio is named after the German band, Einsturzende Neubaten. In general, the three are annoying and I think they are ruining the show more than helping it. The voice acting is very obnoxious and they sound like a stereotypical villain in a kid's show. I know all the voice actors read off a script, but they just sound so unnatural and you can't help but sit there and listen to them reading off said script with the voice they are trying to portray.

The episode was so boring. It felt like it was going on forever. There was no character development this episode and Mu is still a mystery to us. We learn a little about her though. She is most likely either the reincarnation, daughter or is the king of the players as mentioned by Echo and the trio sisters.

I think that the next episode will be better as we get introduced to two new characters. I believe the pink mech we saw is the girl in the ending preview and she is a famous player that Echo knows about.

The mech fights are gross and the CGI is terrible. I don't think this anime will get better.

4384,59760091,6063880,"The anime returns with its fourth episode after delaying productions due to the coronavirus. It wasn't a terrible episode, but it was a very random one with no explanation at all. Those who may have forgotten who the characters were (like me) won't be entirely confused when watching this episode, but altogether this episode was so random and as I mentioned before there was no explanation at all until the very ending, and that explanation was very vague.

We start by being in a dream of Akutagawa. For those who have forgotten who that is, he is one of the first authors we meet in the first episode. Akutagawa is a high-school student who knows nothing when it comes to books.

We meet a boy named Haruka at first glance looks like a girl until we realize it's a boy. It took me a while to realize it was a boy, but anyways Akutagawa seems interested in a book that he is reading. He decided to give it a try, and after doing so he tells Haruka how much he enjoys that book. Soon after that, they become friends, and Haruka gives Akutagawa some recommendations.

Later in the story, the taints (monsters that destroy books) make a slight appearance and destroy important books created by the authors we have met throughout the past four episodes. The ending scene where the teacher was explaining how a world without literature might destroy our world is not a bad point to bring up. I guess the theme of that dream was how much books, literature, and knowledge affect our everyday lives. Due to Haruka's suicide, it had a heavy effect on him and he ended up killing himself because all the pieces of work he enjoyed were destroyed? That's what my guess was. 

Once again, a very random episode that needs more explanation.",0,0

Spoiler  (Click to View)  After reading the discussion thread for episode three, I realized that if you have seen Bungou Stray Dogs, then you might be familiar with some of the characters or have a special connection with them. Since I have not seen Bungou Stray Dogs I sadly don't have this connection that other people who have seen it and are watching this series have.

They can create a connection from certain things from Bungou Stray Dogs and this anime and sadly I don't understand it! Anyways, as I may have mentioned previously this series is a hit or a miss. The last two episodes have been a bit slow, but episode three brought the pace up a little.

I enjoyed episode three. It was a little bit darker than we were expecting, but overall I thought it was a good episode. I was right that Ango was entranced by one of the girls we previously saw in episode two, and it turns out she was the taint. I still can't help but laugh at the phrase.

Ango was able to snap out of the trance and realize who he is, the author of the book! I find it similar to Id:Invaded where Narihisago remembers that he is a true detective. It's sort of like that in this anime. When the authors realize that they wrote the book and they are a character in the story, their appearance changes to what they looked like in the real world.

For the most part, we already knew that Akutagawa was an important character and in the end we see Neko talking about him to someone through some sort of mysterious rock.

Looking at the character list, we will be getting more authors and hopefully, if they keep it up as they did with this episode it will continue to do well in my opinion. Otherwise, it's going to flop. Don't get me wrong, the artwork is so beautiful and the characters look great.

Spoiler  (Click to View)  Overall a pretty boring and bad episode. The anime is currently at a 5.96 rating and that's pretty fair. I was looking forward to the next episode but this was just utterly boring. I found myself dazing off and falling asleep. Yes, it's 2 AM, but I usually don't sleep 'till around 6-7 AM.

I don't think we'll be getting any girls in this episode. It seems like an all-male cast. I thought we were going to get one eventually, but it turned out to be a guy with long hair in a braid. I don't judge, but alright. Additionally, I was going to say that this anime was aimed towards females considering that all the guys are handsome as hell. However, once you get to the end of the episode it turns into a bloodfest and I don't think too many girls would like that!

I'd say around the last 10 minutes of the episode it finally started to get interesting. It was very random, though. I wonder how the fight between Dazai and Ango is going to go. I think the girl that Akutagawa talked to at the community market has something to do with why Ango is killing everyone. He had this weird blue glow in his eye and maybe he's under a spell by her. We've seen a lot of weird stuff in this anime from the two episodes so it wouldn't surprise me if there is magic too.

I enjoyed this episode, of course. I had a lot of laughs and this anime, as I mentioned so many times, doesn't fail to amuse me!

Some questions that I've asked were answered by this episode. In the past discussion posts, I wondered if Hime knew her mother. I don't know entirely for sure if Hime was old enough to remember her. but we know that her mother was alive long enough for her and Gatou to create the birthday boxes as well as to take Hime to the zoo.

Gatou once again getting all the ladies! I love how he is so oblivious, but at the same time, it makes it even better! It's so hilarious how the girls think he's hitting on them when we know the actual context of what's going on. Especially the ""date' between Gatou and Hime's teacher at the zoo.

You can't deny that Hime's artwork is very wholesome! Looking at it from a parent's perspective, it might look terrible, but it's very sweet and I couldn't help but get in the feels.
   

When Gatou remembered that Hime's photo looked familiar and it was because there was a photo of Hime, Gatou, and Hime's mom that was super duper feelsy and it shows how this anime can quickly turn around from laughter to sadness!

Although you don't see the face of Hime's mother, it still gets you in the feel to look back and reflect on the memory. Especially if you were in Gatou's shoes.

Spoiler  (Click to View)  I have said it before and I will say it again, but I am always looking forward to Thursdays and getting to watch this anime. It's cute, funny, but also puts you in the feels at times. Although in my opinion, the slice-of-life hits you more than Yesterday wo Utatte does this season. But that's a debate for another day.

Usually, the ending of the episode has us fast forward to when Hime is older. It looks like the house that her father uses to store the manga is the original house that Gotou and his wife lived in before having Hime. I'm not sure why he moved out, maybe it was to start a new life somewhere else, but he ended up moving in a fairly busy neighborhood with modern homes. He requested that the people building his house keep it a one-floor house and it was designed the same way as their current one. Which is why Hime is surprised that it looks so familiar. 

It seems my question was answered if I asked it but it looks like it was Hime's mom who prepared all the boxes for her. It is well-thought-out and I find it interesting that all the stuff in the box for that year was planned out so well. For example, in the 10-year-old box, there was a cookbook. Hime said she was interested in cooking now. Maybe it was a coincidence or maybe her mother wanted to pass on her legacy to Hime so she created these boxes with things related to her and thought she might like them too. That's a really deep thought.

Gotou ended up making a harem and it was hilarious! We have a cooking lady, flower lady, and even Hime's teacher! All of the scenes where he was casually being himself and making them think he was hitting on them was super funny.

A lot of chatter in the MAL discussion boards regarding the house, what happened to the mother, what happens to Gotou in the future. I am curious as well. As I said before, this anime is really funny and keeps me laughing all the time, but then we get hit with the feels when looking back at Hime's childhood. I am sure once we get to that point in the anime where she is 18 it will be super sad!

You usually go on a few dates, see if you like the person, and it's usually years later that you propose to them. Not instant engagement like this where you are engaged within one minute.

If you don't remember,  I'll refresh your mind. It was most likely the first episode, we saw Well when he was around 25-30 years of age. He had a guild house and he was living with who he's currently partied with, as well as a woman we didn't know too much about. I completely forgot they had another party member.

I usually skip the intro to most anime unless it's outstandingly good so I also forgot about this here:
   

Here is Elise, Well's bride to be.
   
We learn that she's a magic user and can heal people. It looks like healing magic is one of the rarest and hardest skill to have or something like that. I'm not sure if everyone in the church has the ability, but they mentioned other nuns receiving training too.

What sets Well apart from the other people is that even though the people in this anime get along with their arranged marriage, he does things differently. He genuinely looks out for her. I'm not saying the other people don't, considering his brother and his new step-sister are living happily together. Anyways, we can see that he asks for her consent, seeing if she's okay with the marriage. Additionally, when picking out a ring, he makes sure she likes it.

Wondering what the next episode will be like. I don't think they are going to fast forward time now because we need to learn more about Elise and Well's relationship.

Also, Er becomes a retainer or whatever. I'm not sure what that means. Maybe like a squire? I'm guessing it is.

Lastly, Ena and Louise are working together to become Well's wife! They want to have a ""concubine"" with him and I'm wondering if they will succeed.",0,0
4390,59646959,6060102,"Episode three.

Spoiler  (Click to View)  I enjoyed episode three. We finally get to see Well set out on his journey. The first few episodes were okay, but his family is just a bunch of buttheads and I am very happy to see him on his own.

There are some complaints about this anime saying that we still don't see how Well improves his magic. We just started seeing him at the academy and he is already stronger than everyone there. It also seems he is the only magic-user. While I agree it does suck we don't see him get stronger through the academy, we will start to see some more action now that he has formed a team with his classmates.

It was funny but also annoying how everyone was trying to get his attention in class so that they could be Well's partner. He just wanted someone to group up with him while everyone else assumed he wanted the best of the best. Because he's been so alone for all these years it makes sense that he wants some friends. 

Another complaint people made was that this anime could have skipped the whole isekai thing. We only got two minutes of him in his past life and it seems he has completely forgotten hat he was a 25-year-old office worker. Additionally, people are complaining that even though he was 25 in his past life, he is forgetting stuff like having social skills and I can see why this might make people upset. It's indeed weird that he isn't referencing his past life anymore and I do also agree that it's odd he cannot act older than he truly is.

We have the best girl introduced! Ena, the redhead. I don't know much about her but red-headed characters are my favorite. 

Well inherits his master's mansion as well as gets a 1,000 coin payment for delivering some goods to the Duke. Not bad for someone his age. I'm wondering if he'll use that money to buy armor and weapons. From what we've seen in the first episode where he is much older, he learns how to use a sword too so I'm wondering if next episode he'll get sword training.

Let's see what next week has for us.",0,0
4391,59792371,6060099,"Cute and enjoyable episode. Although we didn't get to see any games this episode, we are most likely going to see the first match of the Saitama tournament. If so, the girls will be up against Kagemori. From what it looks like with the data Yoshino has Kagemori is in the last place for their region or something like that.

Yoshino recommends that Ibuki and Risa pitch instead of Yomi for their first game. I think that's a good idea so that Yomi doesn't stress her arm too much at first and she doesn't give away her special pitch.  Those on team Ryoyukan might be watching and observing their time, that is if their matches aren't at the same time.

Some interesting people from other teams. We see Rei go with Fuji-sensei to the meeting to register for the tournament. In terms of design, the characters are boring and average and the artwork looks the same as the main characters other than different hair colors to separate the girls apart. But I am looking forward to seeing the matches and seeing what these girls have to offer.

Hopefully, they aren't too boring. I already know the CGI is going to be a big :thinking emoji:, but I hope the gameplay itself isn't short or stupid like it was in episode four I think it was.",0,0
4392,59713730,6060099,"The good news is that the episode is the master copied and not the bad one like the last episode.

The bad news is that the animation, character art, and CGI are just as awful as the previous episodes.

Altogether though, this episode wasn't too bad in terms of character development. This episode focused on a training camp to help the girls get better. In addition to the training camp, the girls also got some practice games. However, they lost all of those games, hence the ""Losing Streak"" title for episode five.

We learn more about everyone's strengths and weaknesses too. We now know that Nozomi has a hard time cleaning up, but doesn't have a problem getting on base herself. Ibuki and Risa are selected as backup pitchers, that way Yomi isn't always tired and also so she doesn't hurt herself. Ibuki's strength is that she can mimic not only a batter's ""hit style"", but she can also mimic someone's pitching style. However, her weakness is that she throws slow. Risa, on the other hand, has a great fast-ball. I don't think she has any weaknesses as a pitcher just yet.

For everyone, it looks like they are having a hard time fielding and batting too. So that's something they have to work on as a team.

As I mentioned, the character art is once again weird. Sometimes the characters are thicc as hell for no reason, including their face, and then they are skinny all of a sudden. It's very inconsistent and weird. The CGI is just bad. I can't help but wonder what was going through the director's mind when he approved those. I guess since this anime isn't as popular, they don't care too much about how much effort is put into the CGI.

Next episode we'll hopefully see a good match. Nozomi will be hitting clean up so maybe she'll be able to finally clutch a match after discussing with Yoshino.

Yoshino is a great coach/manager. She isn't rude, she can diffuse a situation (nothing drama worth yet, I mean self-doubt, etc), and she knows what's best for the team. She can track everyone's stats, including rival teams to get the advantage they need to win. She's also got a lewd way of getting to know everyone's strengths and weaknesses as we saw her washi-washi hands!

Lastly, we learn that the club advisor was one of the top four in her school or something like that when she played baseball. Meaning, that she isn't just a useless advisor and she has good baseball skills as we see from their practice sessions!",0,0
4393,59677545,6060099,"Episode four is here. If you have watched a version that was released by Funimation, that made a big boo-boo. The version they released was the early master copy. Meaning, all the final touches and such were not added or something? Anyways, this episode was really bad if you watched the Funimation version like me. If you haven't already, watch the AT-X TV Copy!

Alright, now into the episode review!

The girls have their first practice game! It was a very boring episode if I say so myself. I'm going to be reviewing the Funimation version of this episode so there are going to be a lot of complaints. The animation was god awful. You can see where they were going to implement CGI due to how weird certain actions and animations were. It was very unprofessional and not clean. But since this is the early master copy, I can't complain too much since they did end up fixing it on the TV release.

The baseball game itself was boring. The girls ended up losing, but the good thing is they were able to get over the defeat and went straight into practicing again. It's good the girls didn't give up so easily. I might have mentioned it before in previous discussions, but I wanted to see how Yomi's pitching was when it came to an actual game and not her teammates. It looks like the better players were able to hit some of her pitches, but they struggled with her fastball and that ""magic pitch"". Despite this being an obstacle for some players, they were able to hit her fastball.

Other than that it was a pretty boring game. The other team had two good pitchers but we don't know much about them other than Asakura who looked prettier than the other girls if I say so myself. Maybe I just liked her school uniform.

Anyways, the title of the next episode is ""Losing Streak"". I'm guessing the girls have been continuing to play practice games and are constantly losing? We'll see in the next episode and I do hope they fix the problem that they had with the artwork and animation.",0,0
4394,59642189,6060099,"Episode three.

Spoiler  (Click to View)  The anime is slowly getting better. Not a five to a seven better, but five to a six. Of course, some might question is it even worth continuing this series? I don't see the issue with doing so. It's not half-bad. I enjoyed episode three very much.

This anime can be funny at times and very silly and I think that is what is saving the series. Each character has something interesting about that and even though their designs are very wonky and chunky, I like that the voice actresses can make up for that.

We get two new players on the team! Now the club has enough members to officially participate in club events. One girl was a former kendo national champion, Shiragiku, with little to no experience in baseball. She is my best girl pick for this anime. Then there is Nozomi who happens to have experience and what makes her special is that she is left-handed.

With that being said, it looks like we'll be getting our first practice game next episode. I was curious as to when we were going to be getting an official game going on.

The girls are practicing as hard as they can but in actuality, they need to be working harder. As Tamaki said to Yomi, there are other teams with better players working hard until deep into the night. I'm sure we are all tired of these practice scenes and want to see a full game.

The practice game can go one of these many ways: The girls end up losing and their morale is crushed. They end up losing and this boosts their morale. They end up winning and get cocky. We don't know how they perform as a team exactly when it comes down to the pressure of an actual game so this will give us a good idea of whether or not their team is good. Most likely it will be a rough start or maybe not but we know that the girls end up making it to some sort of special game from the preview at the start of episode one.

The next episode is titled, ""Pitch of Promise"" so it looks like Yomi is going to have to put her special pitch to the test here. It will either do them well or flop where another team might be able to hit the pitch like their team captain, Rei, can.

Looking forward to what next week's episode has to offer us.

Also, let's take a moment to appreciate Nozomi's tummy. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

4395,59615896,6060100,"Episode two!

Spoiler  (Click to View)  I'm still not hooked on this anime, but from my observations, it seems that the second episode was much more enjoyed by the community than the first. I guess I can agree with that. Despite being slow for me, (some people thought the pacing was better) there was a lot more going on. Originally, I was going to say ""interesting stuff"", but I felt like this episode wasn't too interesting.

I'm assuming something is interesting about Khun like maybe his family is a branch one and he is a cousin or something of the royalty family, Jahad. Speaking of Jahad, we were able to see Anak Jahad this episode, a very powerful swordswoman (reptile).

Anak's fight with Hatz wasn't anything special because we didn't get an in-depth view of it, but I am sure they are two interesting characters who are going to be strong.

In my opinion, with Rak, Khun, and Bam working together, I already know Bam is going to be successful. There's just no way he fails the tests. Plot armor as I say a million times for various anime I've posted a discussion post on. Khun, as I said before, something is interesting about him. Also, you can tell he is a little fishy and I think he has more motives than just teaming up with Bam. There's something he wants from Bam. Possibly the sword, who knows we'll for sure learn more about it in the future.

My favorite voice actor returns yet again, but this time in a new season! Tsuda Kenjirou, my favorite male voice actor, voices the role of Lero Ro and from what we have seen from those who are Rankers, they aren't one to mess with.

I'll admit that even though I said this episode was slightly boring, I am excited to continue watching it. 

I do hope the tests get harder and we get sucked into some epic storyline. At the moment the tests have been easy or unimpressive to me.

Also, I want to see more of the Jahad family! So far all of the girls in that family are cute.

Lastly, I wonder if we'll see Bam be able to unleash Black March once again. Additionally, it makes me wonder if his sword will be revealed and Anak or someone else from the Jahad family notice. It seems they are the only ones who are wielders of these weapons, as it has their crest (I'm assuming their crest) and how Khun is so interested in it.",0,0
4396,59788722,6060100,"At the beginning of episode seven, we get a little more insight into what even a Jahad is, as well as the Jahad princesses. It turns out, the first person to climb the tower was Jahad. And now he is the king of the tower. There are still many things that are unknown about the king and the princesses but after today's episode, we learn from Endorsi some interesting things. 

As explained in the previous episode, we know that the princesses are not related to the king by blood. They are women chosen from what I am going to assume the king deems worthy of the power the weapons they are given have. One thing I'd like to note is that we haven't seen what weapon Endorsi has. Or have we? Is it her small little knife or does she have another weapon up her sleeve? Good pun? Come on, I had to slip that in there.

What new information is shared is that princesses are not allowed to have intercourse nor are they allowed to have children. Anaak's mother broke this rule and this is most likely the reason she was killed.

I'm still not seeing all the hype for this anime. I still think it's overrated and its insane people are giving this anime such a high rating. To me, this is between a five and a seven. I just don't see the appeal. Call me a hater, which I am, especially if you've read my discussion/reviews for previous anime in this section you know what my taste is.

I think it's cool we are seeing the voice actor for Present Mic from my hero in this anime. He has a voice you can't forget! I had to re-watch the scene where they discussed the fourth test a little bit. Call me an idiot, but the way they explained everything was bad in my opinion and if I had to re-watch it four times to understand it, meh.

We get a list of which character is what role and I am hoping that the next episode will be enjoyable.
   
I think Bam's team is going to win. Seeing that Khun isn't being faithful to his ""friend"" (I use quotes because Khun still seems suspicious) and doesn't think Bam will pass. I think Bam will be able to show off his Shinsu training in the next episode and blow everyone away, literally.",0,0
4397,59753585,6060100,"We were left with a nice little cliffhanger. Although a rather slow episode until the end, it wasn't a bad one. I don't have many complaints to make.

It looks like everyone has to make a group of friends. I'm wondering if that's for the next test. Well, of course, it is but I mean are the friends they add to the list going to be on a single team? I don't think that's the case though. I don't know, it's very confusing lmao. I know everyone was assigned a position, but the teams are split up to fight each other. Since there are five positions to choose from, does that mean three to a team like it's been or is it going to be five per team now?

I think the whole friendship thing might be a way to get close to someone and then secretly betray them. What I mean is, take Hoh for example. He said something like ""It doesn't hurt to make friends with the weak."" I'm wondering what his true intentions are.

It looks like Rak is a Fisherman, Khun is a Lightbearer or Scout, and Bam is a Wave Controller. With the training everyone's going to receive, climbing the tower is going to be increasingly hard. The characters that aren't too special are probably going to become punching bags for those who will climb the tower and although that's boring, I think it will allow us to see the true potential of everyone's ability.

We can already see that some people are struggling in their training. Rak was able to pass his test, Khun is getting some insight into the other people training, and Bam looks like he is doing a good job controlling his Shinsu.

Shibisu is a funny guy. I think adding his comedic aspect to whatever's going on is a good call.

We see that Rachel wants Khun to lie to Bam that she is not Rachel. Bam can see through Khun's lies, but that doesn't stop him. He is going to use this as motivation to get stronger and with that, Bam is slowly becoming a likable person to me. However, he just needs to stop simping for this girl.

I'm happy to see more of Endorsi, despite her being a b*tch, but I love that cocky attitude. Oh boy! She sure likes to stir up drama, especially with Anak.

So a few of my questions were asked this episode regarding the princesses. It was stated, ""The princesses of Jahad are recruited to represent capable tribes and families"". Which makes sense considering the sisters don't look identical. It's not uncommon for anime to have twins or relatives that look-a-like, but I haven't seen that too often in anime these days.

We also learn that Anak isn't the real Anak, but her daughter. Her mother, the real Anak was supposedly killed by the Jihad princesses.

During their little fight between Anak and Endorsi, Anak called Endorsi a ""horned woman"". I'm wondering if that was just a general insult or there is more to Endordsi we haven't learned yet.",0,0
4398,59714619,6060100,"I'm always so negative about things but I just can't help it. I'm entitled to my opinion though so I can't complain.

Boring episode again, but everyone on MAL enjoyed it. I just didn't find it as exciting as everyone thought it was. We learn what Khun's bag can do, which is the ability to clone stuff. It was very useful in this crown game. He was even able to sneak in three members from the first test because of the bag. I'm wondering what it looks like inside!

Bam's team win's the fourth round due to the help of the three members Khun snuck in. They agreed to assist him. I think Khun's ability to think ahead and come up with strategies is great, meanwhile, Rak has the brawns. Well, Bam is pretty strong too, I guess if he tried with Black March, but he's a whiney little simp who's useless unless his little girlfriend gets hurt or something and he somehow activates a shinsu ability like never seen before. This, of course, is going to help him get to the tower quickly.

I'm not a fan of Rachel. She's very mysterious and her goal seems selfish rather than helping Bam, which we all know is a simp for her.

Anyways, the fighting was boring, I'm wondering why Endorsi's team didn't want to kill off Bam's team.

From the character list on MAL, it seems the girl with the bodysuit is named ""Hwaryun"", and I' wondering if we'll see her again.

I want to see more of Endorsi though. I sound like a simp myself now but she got some nice features. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",0,0
4399,59602665,6044641,"I just finished watching episode two and episode three with my beloved friend,  Soulmate～っ☆   , He is more ahead of me in the story and was kind enough to go back and watch it with me. We finally had some free time to continue the series! I'll be writing discussions every so often as we finish up this series whenever we can.

The second episode was a little bit boring. The story in this episode was a bit slow and I found my brain wandering off throughout the episode. The CGI is still a little bit weird to me but it doesn't completely ruin the anime.

When we get into the third episode, it starts to get more interesting. Once again, I felt like the story was a little bit slow in this episode, but we were able to get a little more action which is a plus. Additionally, we learn that Nikaido is a sorcerer! I'm sure Kaimen will think thoroughly about this but in the end, stay loyal to her.

Fujita and Ebisu's relationship is funny and I am always laughing when she's running off to do something stupid and he has to fix her mess. I'm alright with girls who like to workout or tend to be more muscular than others, but Noi's body is just unrealistic and it's kind of weird and gross to look at during certain scenes.

The gore and violence do not upset me as much as it does in other anime. Usually, when I watch these types of anime I hate it. The gore and violence are just exaggerated and I'm not trying to see a million arms and legs fly across the room with blood splattered across my screen. With this anime, it is exaggerated but I can tolerate it which is good.

I'm not sure when we'll be able to watch the fourth episode so I'm probably going to forget stuff as I did with the first episode. But I am looking forward to it. The story is about to get interesting and I'm hoping it continues to go well. Despite being slow, at least there is a plot being followed.",0,0

 Quote:Hole—a dark, decrepit, and disorderly district where the strong prey on the weak and death is an ordinary occurrence—is all but befitting of the name given to it. A realm separated from law and ethics, it is a testing ground to the magic users who dominate it. As a race occupying the highest rungs of their society, the magic users think of the denizens of Hole as no more than insects. Murdered, mutilated, and made experiments without a second thought, the powerless Hole dwellers litter the halls of Hole's hospital on a daily basis.

Possessing free access to and from the cesspool, and with little challenge to their authority, the magic users appear indomitable to most—aside for a few. Kaiman, more reptile than man, is one such individual. He hunts them on a heedless quest for answers with only a trusted pair of bayonets and his immunity to magic. Cursed by his appearance and tormented by nightmares, magic users are his only clue to restoring his life to normal. With his biggest obstacle being his stomach, his female companion Nikaidou, who runs the restaurant Hungry Bug, is his greatest ally.

Set in a gritty world of hellish design, Dorohedoro manages a healthy blend of comedy and lightheartedness with death and carnage. Taking plenty of twists and turns while following the lives of Hole's residents, it weaves a unique world of unearthly origin and dreary appearance not for the squeamish or easily disturbed.

Spoiler  (Click to View)  A few complaints this episode, but nothing crazy like I usually do. I don't like Karyl too much only because of her annoying tsundere attitude. The way she's constantly doing it is very annoying. If she did the attitude every so often I'd be fine with it, but constantly hearing her moan and whine but then secretly opening up is annoying.

We understand that from the last episode, food is the main subject in this anime. I find that very unique as there aren't too many fantasy adventure anime revolved around food. I guess you can say this is the Food Wars of that genre. Not really, but close enough.

Pecorine got a part-time job for what, a day? Now she's off to be an adventurer. Interesting.

The group finally form a guild called the Gourmet Guild. Their goal is to travel across the land and eat food together. It sounds like an awesome guild to me. Considering this anime is going to be revolved around food, I'm sure we'll get some bits and pieces of critiquing. Maybe an Interspecies Reviewers, but no porn, and food? Maybe with some action sprinkled in since we know Pecorine can fight.

I still think the main character is useless. How is he even the main character? He adds nothing but a bowl of stupid to this anime. At least Peco is dumb, but she is useful in the end. Are they even going to try and get his memories back as we saw in episode one?

Lastly, what was that scene with the girl falling over? It seemed she was either tired or poisoned. The idiot decides to give her food and asks if she's hungry. Maybe she was, but she seemed like an adventurer that could afford her meals. Then, she has this weird face like she's interested in him. Very weird that even was put in this episode.",0,0
4404,59632240,6064862,"Episode two!

Spoiler  (Click to View)  This anime has gotten better with the second episode. I enjoyed it a lot more and I think it will start to get better. Last episode we were faced with two idiots as MC's and a cute loli elf trying her best to tame one of the idiots.

For some, Peco and Yuuki have disliked characters because of how stupid they are. I can agree with that. However, with the most recent episode, it adds some good comedy. Pecorine makes a great character and despite being as dumb as a block of wood, she is super powerful and the way she fights is really impressive.

To compare this anime with the other adventure ones airing this season such as Shachou, battle no Jikan desu!"", ""Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou!"" and ""Shironeko Project: ZERO CHRONICLE"" this has been the most enjoyable so far, despite there only being two episodes. I can already see this anime doing far better than those three.

If you are looking for that comedic adventure anime where you can sit back and relax this is it. After taking a look at the discussions, it turns out the director for this anime directed Konosuba. You'll be getting some Konosuba references in this anime too and even some of the voice actors from Konosuba are in this anime.

We are met with a new character. The tsundere cat Karyl who seems to be a high mage or something of the like. She has great magic abilities and it seems she might even be stronger than kokkoro when it comes to magic.

The only complaint I have is that Yuuki had no character development this episode. With this anime supposedly being based around him, I am not sure why the girls were focused more than him. But I won't complain as all three of them are cute.

The foursome find themselves starting a guild! The guild revolves around finding the best food. I think that is a unique one, considering we haven't seen anything like this maybe at all. I'm going to assume we'll continue getting awesome action fights and comedic moments while getting ingredients to cook food as well as traveling to the best restaurants.

The animation and sound production is well done. I was impressed with how well everything looked and how smooth the fighting scene between the dragon was.

This episode focused more on Maria and Katarina's relationship. Additionally, we learn more about Maria. Katarina and Maria become close when she once again saves her from bullies in the school. It looks like people are jealous of her because she's a commoner and she has higher grades and she's better at magic than them. 

Katarina randomly wants to go out and look at farms so that she can improve the one she's created at her house. She dresses up as a commoner and learns more about the vegetables you can plant and I guess how to grow them. While leaving, she ends up visiting Maria's home town. This is where we learn through her mother's memories that her childhood was a bit rough because she was the only commoner who can conduct magic. This is probably why she didn't have too many friends and she doesn't know how to interact outside of class.

I feel bad for her, Maria is such a sweet girl! It's also funny how all the girls are obsessed with her rather than the people they are supposed to marry, be with.

The ending with Katarina's mother was super funny. I wouldn't mind her giving me a special talk. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",0,0

Spoiler  (Click to View)  The second episode was a bit more fast-paced than the first and overall it was a great episode. Sadly, this anime is going to be postponed after the third episode but with everything that is going on in the world, I can't help but get angry.

I'm still not a fan of Appare. Don't get me wrong, he is great at what he does, but since he is selfish he comes off as a d*ck. At times he can be endearing, but you can't tell because of his selfish attitude.

Kosame was an absolute clown in this episode. He made me laugh so much and he's such a great character.

We are introduced to Xia Lian, a Chinese girl working for the race track as a mechanic. She wants to become a racer in the future, but with how the times are like in this anime, women don't have too many rights. Appare says that she should prove all these men wrong and show that women can drive. She is a cute character and her design is nice, however, I dislike her introduction. I get that she was mad at Appare and Kosame for breaking into the racetrack and damaging her car, but she is too quick to judge and I hate people like that.

Next episode looks interesting. The title says, ""Duel"" and I am curious to know what kind of dueling will happen. We can see how America has evolved as a country as this is also labeled a historic anime. Some of the characters have guns, while Kosame, from Japan, has a katana. I'm wondering if the dueling relates to racing. We'll have to wait and see.

Looking at it now, I might have mentioned it before, but if I didn't the seiyuu for this anime is pretty stacked. A lot of known people.



Notice: After episode three, the anime will be postponed until further notice! Saving this here for personal record.

 Quote:During the back-end of the 19th century, the genius but socially awkward engineer Sorano Appare and the wise yet cowardly samurai Isshiki Kosame find themselves drifting in the sea between Japan and America. With no money, the duo decide to enter the Trans-America Wild Race to win the prize money so they can get home. The two encounter rivals, bandits, and challenges in the wilderness as they race through America, from the starting line in Los Angeles to the finish line in New York, in the steam-powered car they built.

Spoiler  (Click to View)  Fairly good start to an episode. At first, I thought I was going to dislike the car racing due to the CGI. The CGI wasn't terrible, but when it comes to cars and anime I just don't like it. It could be worse though so I won't complain too much.

We get a backstory of how Appare and Kosame make it to America. I think the two of them, despite being completely different, are perfect buddies for each other. Because they are so different,  they complement one another in what they lack.

The characters, in general, are okay. I like how Appare stands out with his colorful hair and colorful outfit. I like how he is willing to change and learn more about technology while Japan was still skeptical about it at first. He is willing to risk it all for technology. At the moment, he is my only character of interest despite me hating his character image. Some cute girls in this. Jing looks interesting and I'm wondering what her personality will be like.

This anime has the tag of historical and I think that adds something new for the first time in a while. The time is back during the 19th-century and there are a lot of things that I remember from my Asian history as well as my American class that is happening in this anime.

I'm looking forward to next week as the pacing of the first episode was good and the time went by super quickly.",0,0

Spoiler  (Click to View)  I've only gone fishing once and it was when I was very young. Maybe eight. I wasn't able to catch anything and I don't think I would considering where I went fishing... Regardless, watching this anime really makes me want to start fishing just for fun!

I would say this episode was the slowest so far when it came to the fishing itself. The girls were going for a flathead fish and it took them a while but Hina was able to get one for herself! While trying to catch it, she struggled and almost fell into the water because of how scared she was. My only complaint is how annoying she is when it comes to the actual fish. At first, it was cute, but now that she was able to catch such a big fish, it got a little bit annoying that everyone had to hold her hand an assist her. It has nothing to do with the fact that she's new. She's just a big crybaby when it comes to the fish itself which is a bit annoying. I know she was dragged into the club originally and wanted to join the crafting club, but still! Dang girl, don't be scared of a fish!

I like how informative this anime is. I said it before, but they go into detail on certain things most of us probably have no idea about when it comes to fishing. Despite Yuuki's, I wouldn't say lack of enthusiasm, more of a casual, lax way of talking, she makes the explanations enjoyable and cute!

Oono's reactions to everything always gets me laughing. I love how despite her mysterious look because her glasses cover her eyes, she's actually a nice girl and very sweet to everyone! Whenever Hina does something stupid, it's very funny to see how Oono reacts.

It looks like in the next episode they'll be going to a wharf location? I think that's what it's called? I said it previously but I like how the previews don't spoil next week's episode. With that being said, we have no idea what fish they'll be going for next week!

Not only does this anime get me interested in fishing, but it also makes me hungry! I'm not the biggest seafood fan, however, I do like crab, lobster, shrimp, cod, and salmon, and I used to eat sushi a lot before the quarantine. Watching this show has me craving for all of those and it sucks!",0,0

Spoiler  (Click to View)  It's a shame to see this anime in such a low rating at 6.95, but that's not terrible. I usually classify anime below five to be bad and boring.

This anime is potentially and most likely my favorite anime of the season. It's an obvious CGDCT anime, but with fishing. I think this anime will be missed by a bunch of people because it's about fishing. Last season, I deeply enjoyed Asteroid in Love and I knew people thought that was a flop because of astronomy and earth science.

However, this anime has better pacing and the comedic aspect to it is much better than Asteroid in Love. I found myself laughing so much during this second episode it was very funny. These four are an absolute blast to watch and they all have little things that make them funny or interesting.

The OP and the ending are very cute and wholesome. It gives you a good vibe and this anime is a nice anime to watch, especially during this dumb quarantine as you can relax and enjoy yourself.

What I like about the ending previews is that they are so short that they don't spoil the next episode. We have no idea what we'll be getting. And since I am enjoying this so much it's fine knowing that I'm going to be getting myself into a random episode that day. They could have just removed the previews in general because they are only two seconds long and showcase nothing.

However, those short two seconds might lead us to guess what the next episode will be about. I believe the girls will be going to the beach in episode three. Whether it be fishing or for a nice fan service episode I am excited to see!

This episode focused on Hina getting better at casting her fishing rod. Just like Asteroid in Love which explained different things regarding astronomy and earth science, this anime also does the same but about fishing. Even though we might not care about fishing and we may never practice it, it's interesting to learn about it through cute girls!

So far I've given this an anime rating of an eight! Let me know if you also enjoy this! Can't wait for next Tuesday.",0,0

Spoiler  (Click to View)  Houkago Teibou Nisshi is currently my favorite anime airing this season. After watching so many first episodes this week and last week, so far this one has been my absolute favorite. Earlier in the week, I said I enjoyed Yesterday wo Utatte but this completely blows it out of the water, literally.

We have Hina, a high school girl moving into a new seaside town. As a person from the suburbs or I'm assuming city, she doesn't have that much knowledge of the area, where it prides itself on fishing.

She meets Yuuki and from there she teachers her how to fish. Later on, she meets an old friend Natsumi who wants Hina to join their fishing club, the Teibou or Breakwater fishing club.

Soon enough she joins the club and fishes with them! I think this anime is great. We probably won't learn too much about fish, but I'm sure we'll see some awesome creatures that the club catches. From the ending preview, it looks like the girls will possibly travel around the town and go to different locations to fish.

This is a very laidback and wholesome anime. I laughed so many times and the girls are cute. I love how funny Hina is and she's a clown. Makoto is also an interesting character and she seems very mysterious, but I can see that she's very kind and sweet. Yuuki is funny and I like how relaxed she is and how much she teases Hina. Natsumi is okay, she seems like the most energetic out of the group but I don't find her that special.

I'm looking forward to continuing this anime and even though it's a weird topic of ""cute girls doing cute things"" (fishing isn't that cute, but it's cute girl's doing it) I think it's going to do well!",0,0

4417,59552979,6044276,"Episode 11 was for sure meant to make you cry. I didn't cry, but if you get emotional and you enjoy this anime, I'm sure you would.

We finally get Nicole's backstory. She had a sad, tough childhood and was bullied by her classmates for being nervous. You wouldn't expect that from the top idol. Of course, those bullies made her the way she is today. Also, we learned in the preview of episode 10 that Miu was in the same class as Nicole.

In episode 11, we see that they connect. Probably because they were both quiet and shy, Miu saw that she could connect to Nicole in some sort of way.

We learn at a young age Nicole is interested in idols. Finally, besides Miu we see someone interested in some sort of music. Other than Miu and Nicole, as I've said before, and I'll repeat, these two girls are the only ones that have announced they wanted to pursue some sort of career in music or have had an interest in music. Miu with the piano and Nicole with being an idol.

I won't go into the school play but because of what happened, Miu had to transfer schools. As Nicole said, it's not surprising that Miu had no idea who Nicole was after all these years. I think with Nicole remembering who Miu was, all the harsh words and things she said was to keep motivating her because of what Miu did for Nicole back in the school play.

It's interesting to see how Miu stuck up for Nicole back then. Also, it shows who she is as a character now too. She cares about those close to her, and as Nicole said, there's no saying what Miu would do to protect the one's she cares about.

I think the last episode is going to be interesting. They might come back together as a group? The weird stuffed animal that I've been saying is some sort of spy device randomly activates and says ""Welcome to 22/7"". I'm wondering what is going to happen.",0,0
4418,59509990,6044276,"Episode nine was about Ayaka's backstory. And it was a good one too. We don't know much about her and we finally got to see a little behind the scenes of how she was before an idol.

She was annoying as a child. A big cry baby and her constant crying very annoying, but even though her sisters loved her, they bullied her a little bit. But most siblings usually do that at a young age so it's nothing bad.

We learn that at a young age she starts liking manga. And then in middle school, she starts drawing it. She's very good at it too. To us, we think it's just an average hobby that she likes to do on the side. But to Ayaka, she believes being an idol is the side job and her real job is drawing manga.

Once again, we don't get a background on her singing and how she was chosen as an idol. She was just chosen. I am not a fan of this, but it is what it is.

""The Wall"" had a new order for the girls in this episode. It was for them to bond by going to a hot spring and spending the night there. Then, they were to perform on the 24 of December to celebrate their first anniversary.

We don't get to see the concert so I'm not sure if they did it or not. At the ending preview, we get an order created saying ""Disband"". Everyone is shocked, including me. I thought it was going to be about Nicole since we haven't had her backstory yet. Will we be getting a backstory episode for her? We'll have to find out.

Anyways, yeah, I was shocked when I saw it said for them to disband. I know that they'll probably whine and complain that this can't be happening, but they've been following the orders from ""the wall"" for so long that I think they'll end up disbanding. Since there are only three episodes left, I wonder what's going to happen.",0,0
4419,59473557,6044276,"Episode 7 we got to learn more about Jun. It turns out, that all of the girls besides her got food poisoning last episode, which makes sense to why they passed out. A good amount of people in other discussions thought that the girls were purposely drugged.

This was for sure a very sad episode, much more so than Reika's story in episode 6. We learn that Jun had respiratory problems and was in and out of the hospital for years. She had met a friend for the first time and they spent a while with each other and it made Jun so happy. Soon enough, the friend she made, I believe her name was Yuu, ended up passing away. This, of course, devasted Jun and made her an absolute wreck. After the passing of Yuu, Jun ends up recovering 100% and is able to resume normal activities again. Jun says that all of Yuu's passion in life passed onto her. And it's very evident that it is true. Jun is probably one of the most hyper and most active member of the group. I guess for the better, she's changed and she looks at things with a more positive attitude now than ever before.

Reika definitely had a sad upbringing too, but as I said I think Jun's story was 85% more sad. What I still don't understand is how they got selected to be an idol. From Miu and Sakura's story, we get a glimpse of their life and how they are related to music but for Reika and Jun, there is no connection at all. I guess it's the doing of ""the wall"".

Jun running around and doing all the things the wall wanted them to do in episode 6 but never got to was pretty funny. It's awesome how much energy she had and every interaction with the manager was funny!

It's good to see all the girls are healthy and are feeling better. Jun definitely will have the best bond out of all of them and I know she'll never betray them in anyway. Also, she'll respect all of their friendship because of what happened to her in her younger years and I think that in itself makes a good friend. Someone who is loyal and someone who cares. She might be the most annoying out of the bunch, but she definitely is the most caring.

Lastly, the ending preview shows a new slab from the wall. It says that they are going to perform a live show for 3,000 people. That's a good number actually. 22/7 in the anime is fairly popular and I think if they did more than 3,000 that would be a little outrageous. Where did they get all those fans from? I hope they perform a decent song and for the love of anime, please have them change outfits!! Are we going to get more backstories next week? It doesn't seem like it. I'd like to learn more about Nicole mostly, but also Akane too! Because the title is named ""Dreaming Robot"" it might be about Akane's backstory? We'll have to wait and see! See you next week.",0,0
4420,59580233,6044301,"Koisuru Asteroid, also known as Asteroid in love, was a very cute and wholesome anime. It's a shame that not too many people liked it. I said it in multiple discussion posts, but this anime is not for everyone. Although it's cute girls doing cute things, it's very niche. Those who do not like astronomy and geology simply wouldn't like this anime.

My final rating for this anime is a seven. Originally, it was an eight, but I think that's stretching it out too far. After re-thinking my rating, I thought seven was a better choice.

The characters in this anime won't surprise you at all. They are bland, but what makes them unique is that each of them has their own preference when it comes to the club. Some prefer astronomy while others prefer geology. Additionally, within that preference, they have something that they like specifically. For example, Inose liked mapping, and Monroe-senpai wanted to be an astronaut. Despite that, I thought all the girls were cute. Everything about them was adorable. I even believe that these girls are great for avatars and icons if you can find a good screenshot.

The story was alright. It had bad pacing during a few episodes. For example, it was fall semester and all of a sudden the third-years graduated. I did learn a little bit about each of the science clubs, but it's nothing that we'll remember. It'll just be a memory that will eventually be flushed out by other things. I'm sure everyone who watches this will sadly forget about it. I had a few laughs throughout the episode and there were a lot of cute yuri moments!

The ending didn't tear me up, but just like Somali-chan's final episode, we got a small collage of the girls from past episodes. This made me sad because it reminded me of the journey this anime took us through.

Also, because this is an anime about high schoolers, I felt more emotional watching the ending of this than I did with Somali-chan. I think because I have already experienced graduating high school and moving onto bigger things in life, it makes me sad that I am going to be moving on and probably never even remembering these characters again. And when I look back in the future and see my list of things watched, I'll see this and remember some of the memories that were born because of this anime.

4421,59549404,6044301,"Episode 11 was a very cute one. I enjoyed it very much. It turns out Ao didn't need to sneak in after all! She would have been able to come as an observer to the event!

It goes to show once again how Japanese culture is different from other places. Everyone was saying how Ao had a lot of guts to sneak in on a plane and go to the event and surprise Mira. Some might say it's a little rude, others might. I guess it depends on the person. I don't anything wrong of it. I'm glad that she decided to do this. However, if she stayed home we saw what she would have done with the club.

 It's good to see Monroe-senpai and Sakura-senpai still in the show. They were able to take the new members and Inose to the space observatory and have them experience what they did before graduating.

This anime does make me sad though, knowing that it's coming to an end. Although the spacing was a bit off and weird, this show had me hooked from the start. Knowing that the next episode is the last is kind of sad.

I'm happy we are getting more of the astronomy side of the club these past few episodes as that is why I decided to watch the show. It's cool to see that Ao was allowed to observe even though she didn't put that in Mira's applciation before coming. It's also nice that the people running the event allowed her to participate in certain events. She's basically in the event to an extent.

Ao and Mira and Suzu and Misa. Each episode that romance grows bigger and bigger and just baits us even more. Sadly for Suzu, it seems like her love for Misa has come to an end. She cut her hair and changed it to start the new year. Usually, girls do this quite often after something happens in their life and they want to have a fresh new start. It's nice to see her change and I'm glad the producers followed up with the situation between her and Misa as we were left in the dark after the Valentine's Day episode.

The club gets two new members! Chikage aka Chika who is Sakura's younger sister and Yuu aka Nana. We learn that Nana is into meteorology. Sadly, her reasoning happens to be a sad one, but she seems very passionate about the subject. Chika is also interested in rocks and minerals like her older sister, but what's unique about her is that Chika likes fortune-telling. Her fortune-telling skills seem to be good too! She was able to predict the future for Ao and Mira.

Ao and Mira are trying to enter some sort of star competition. We'll learn more about it next episode, but it appears that Ao was not accepted but Mira was. Of course, this took the girls by surprise and they were upset about it. The event takes place in Okinawa and as Mira arrives, Ao also seems to have gone too.

Soon after that, it was Valentine's Day. Sakura being the cute tsundere she is, wanted to make candy for the girls in the club. Ah, tsundere girls are great.

The exchanging of candy scene was beautiful and all the girls were cute. I'm so happy they get along. I love Inose-senpai and Sakura-senpai the most. They are my two favorite characters in this anime.

Right after that, the girls had a graduation party for Sakura and Monroe-senpai. I'm wondering what the rest of the anime will be like now that they are no longer in the school. Will we still see them or are they completely done? 

I was reading reviews on the anime for this episode and it appears people are complaining about the pacing. I can see why that's an issue. At times, things are rushed and throughout the episode timeflies by so quickly so I can understand why people are complaining about it. We went from Valentine's Day to Sakura and Monroe graduating, that's a big pacing issue.

Last thing I want to talk about was the ending! Ao and Mira are second years now and Inose is a third year! The club is looking for new members and it seems two girls are interested.

Episode 6 left us with Sakura and Monroe-senpai appointing Inose as the leader of the club. Considering that both of them will be graduating this year, I think it's a good idea to appoint a leader now, rather than later to avoid any confusion.

This episode, we get to see more of the astronomy side of the club. We get to learn more about some stars and a little bit of Saturn. Nothing too serious though, as the club does a group activity with kids of the neighborhood who are interested in astronomy.

Inose is having a hard time with being the new leader. She is very nervous throughout the whole episode, but I think she'll be able to overcome it. I'm not sure what will happen in the next episode, but it looks like she found an event the club can participate in. It looks very earth science like so we'll most likely be getting the earth science side of the club next episode.

Also, we are seeing Sakura and Monroe less. I'm not sure why. 

At this point in the show, if you are bored or not into astronomy or earth science, you are probably going to remain bored. This anime is not for everyone.

If anything, you would think Mira would get it, but this also shows that despite Mira supposedly being the main character of the anime, we get to see more out of the others.

4427,59452138,6045988,"Episode 6 we were able to see both sides of the main characters. The past three episodes or so have mostly been about Ikuto, with a little bit of Chiyuki mixed into it. Now, episode 6 had the perfect balance of having them both with a good amount of screen time, but Ikuto still, for sure, had more.

Let's start with Ikuto. I'm glad that his design was able to get past the first round and he was even lucky enough to get top three so that he can advance to the final round instantly. I'm not too much into fashion or designer brands in itself, (then why do I like this show? Ask me again later.) so I didn't think Ikuto's design was all that special, but when you see what thought he put into creating it, such as the fact that Seira hardly has any loungewear photos on her social media account and also that she likes stripes. I would have never come up with something like this so I give him props.

Soon after, Toh offers Ikuto a job at his company that he wants to start. We still never got to see the discussion between Mr. Yanagida and Toh about Toh wanting to hire Ikuto. I'm wondering if he'll be okay with Ikuto joining Toh, as Ikuto accepted the job. Let's hope next episode we get to see them work together so that Ikuto can make the very best for the final show.

Now, Chiyuki. Sadly, she had a bit of trouble in this episode. She has been applying to model jobs, but sadly none are accepting her. She's really cute and it sucks that just because she's short, no one wants to take photos of her or have her model their clothes. You can see in the interview with the lady at one of the agencies that she had no interest. Soon after, she was invited and hired for some event so I am hoping we see more of her in episode 7 too.

Here are some cute pics of Chiyuki! See you next week.

4428,59406546,6044292,"Don't have much to say about the latest episode, but we finally get to see another human. I don't think Golem is going to do anything to harm the harpy girl (Uzoi), but I'm interested in seeing how he difuses the situation. You can see in the preview Somali trying to escape from her, so we know the very least she puts up a fight and tries to run away. My thoughts are as she's doing so, she'll try and convince Uzoi that violence isn't the answer to this situation, but at the same time since Somali is so young she probably doesn't have the experience to think that way. So eventually, Haitora and Golem will catch up to save Somali.

I'm also interested in seeing what happens once the situation is defused. I doubt Golem and Somali are going to die off anytime soon (if they do at all), but I predict after some verbal altercations with everyone that she'll come to realize what she did was wrong and everyone will be on their way. After that, I'd like to see if Haitora passes away from being sick or if he survives and everyone goes their separate ways or they continue to cross the desert still. I believe it's the latter because they need that cart obviously to travel.",0,0

4430,59568407,6050402,"I'm not too much of a fan when it comes to idol anime, but I will give my honest and final review for Oshi ga Budoukan Ittekuretara Shinu.

My final rating for this anime is a seven. Honestly, it should be a six, but frequently throughout the anime, I had a few laughs. Additionally, I didn't find myself too bored when watching this and the animations weren't terrible other than the fact that the coreography of the girls were awful and bland.

Speaking of bland, the story in itself was super bland. The goal of this anime was to see the girls from the idol group ChamJam progress as a small idol group and make their way to perform at the Budoukan, which is one of Japan's largest domes. That being said, performing at a dome practically means you made it as an artist in Japan. These domes can hold over 50,000 people. Most concerts here in America only hold around 3,000 people. That's a huge difference!

After looking at the characters, they not special. You've probably heard me say this multiple times during my final reviews. Well, that's the case here once again. No girl stands out other than the top three, which is Sorane, Reo, and whoever is third at the time since it switches based on popularity. Each girl has a color that represents them. You usually see the color blue and red among the fans so there isn't much competition as to who is the most popular.

The songs were lacking. In general, they were lacking. What I mean is there was a lack of songs! Despite being an idol anime the girls only performed three songs, one of them being repeated majority of the time!

I slightly discussed the dancing already, but there wasn't anything good. When it comes to idol anime dancing usually sucks unless they use CGI and even then the CGI is usually awful.

I can see the appeal of liking idols in real life. Me being a K-Pop fan, I just can't seem to like Japanese idol anime. Maybe I am just biased so take that into account when reading this review.

The story sucked. The spacing wasn't the best and there was a lot of repeated themes that went on during this anime.

Would I recommend it? No, I would not. Yes, the comedic aspect was funny here and there but that wasn't enough to entice me enough to like the show.",0,0

At the moment, the anime has a rating of 7.25. I have given this anime a rating of 8, but I think 7 is a good one for this. At times, it's very repetitive and it can repeat the same content over and over again but with different events going on. For example, fan meetings are always the same group of people saying hello but the questions and interactions are always different.

I think that the characters are bland and there is nothing special about them. Past episodes we learn about some of the girls and we can see who is better at what, but there isn't stuff that makes them too special.

Reo and Sorane are probably the most well-liked in terms of the anime. I doubt anyone likes any of the girls enough in the anime to have a favorite.

What I do like about this anime is how it pokes and jabs at anime and idol fans. The jokes in it are funny and very accurate.

4432,59564950,6044559,"Now that the anime is over, more reviews that aren't biased based off of the Nekopara visual novel on Steam have come to light. And I thank those people. It amazes me how people gave this a high eight and above just because they liked the visual novel game. Well, that's great, but your rating is meaningless.

At the end of this anime, the current rating at the time of this post is 6.92, close to a seven. This is a pretty good average. My final rating for this anime is a six. I was expecting so much from this anime and they completely ruined. Who doesn't love catgirls?

The story was lacking. Moreso, there was no real story at all. The anime didn't follow a plot. It was a random episode every week so we never knew what we were getting. There was no ending preview and no episode continued into the next.

The characters were okay. I already knew about the girls from the video game as well from the Nekopara movie but they didn't do anything to impress me in this anime. Of course, Maple is best girl though. Cacao was an annoying character. I dislike her completely and adding her to this anime was a tremendous mess. She's troublesome, annoying, and adds nothing to the anime. Every episode that was based on her doing something stupid like running away or being a complete moron made me hate this anime more and more.

The final episode, episode 12, finally gave us the episode I was saying they needed to add. The beach episode. Well, after watching the final episode I wasn't impressed, once again. It's your typical beach episode. The girls go to the mall, look at some swimsuits, but we don't get to see them try them on, only Cacao. We're finally at the beach and we get a few snippets of the girls in their swimsuits, but once again, they don't do anything fun. It's your typical beach anime episode we all know and have seen. I'm surprised it took the final episode to even do this. Heck, I was sure they weren't even going to do a beach episode.

Would I recommend this anime? No, I wouldn't. If you are a fan of the Nekopara visual novel on Steam, note that this is nothing like those. You may or may not be disappointed when watching this. This anime had so much potential and it's sad to see it go to waste. There's no hint for another season, but maybe in the future, we'll get something else like another movie.",0,0
4433,59455159,6044559,"Episode 7 was fairly good. I enjoyed the girls being alone together this episode, rather than having them work at the shop or having them do stupid stuff which they've been doing lately. Kashou, also known as ""master"" in this anime isn't anything special at all. I guess he plays an important role, but more so in the movie than the anime itself. I'd say Shigure is more important in this anime.

Anyways, the girls are left alone in the house due to a terrible storm. They tell stories which aren't interesting, but some were funny. Vanilla's talk about ghosts in every story gave me some laughs and Cinnamon being a horny weirdo added some comedy too.

Most recently, I've been paying close attention to voice actors and seeing how well they do. I have noticed a lot of voice actors this season sound either terrible or they sound like they are reading a script. Of course, they are reading a script, but as a voice actor, you have to play the part. If you are playing the part, but I'm still able to hear that you are reading off a script it's awkward. I don't think it's necessarily the VA's fault, but at the same time, I kind of do.

Maple especially, probably because I like her the most but also her ""uptight, classy"" personality that some anime have might be the reason why her voice acting is like that.

I don't have much to discuss this week but I noticed in the op that Shigure dressed up as a catgirl so enjoy this picture, and see you next week!

4434,59442141,6044559,"We are now 6 episodes in and halfway done with the anime! This episode was a bit wonky and weird at times, but overall I enjoyed it. The animation wasn't smooth during certain scenes, but I can't complain too much about it. You can see a bit during the running relay event that was going on, that some bits and pieces were a bit rough, but it wasn't terrible to the point where you can laugh at it or it ruins the whole experience of the anime.

I thought that this team event was a good episode. We focus on Coconut and Azuki instead of the usual Chocola, Vanilla, or Cacao so this episode is even more of a plus to me. I don't hate them (but I do dislike Cacao, just annoying and nothing special at the moment), but to finally have a break from them and focus on the other girls is awesome. I already knew at the end of the event the girls were going to make up. It's so cliche and it was bound to happen and if you didn't expect that to happen you are silly.

There was a bit of fan-service in this episode. Reminded me a lot of Keijo but less explicit. That reminds me, I wouldn't mind a second season of Keijo.

I think a beach episode would be perfect for this anime. It already screams fan-service in a few of the episodes, especially with Cinnamon being a pervert most of the time. I'm not sure if in the movie there was a beach scene, but for sure, a day at the beach would be interesting. However, I don't think cats like water too much in real life. But, we do know that these girls are okay with showering so I don't think it would be too bad of an episode.

Of course, people have different opinions and ratings for anime, but I feel like this anime is around a 6-7. I'm not too much of a fan of the new character, Cacao, and I find her fairly annoying. I understand that she's a kitten and she still has a lot to learn, but I think the anime is losing that potential by just focusing on her. For the past few episodes that she's been living in the house with Chocla and Vanilla, she's caused nothing but trouble and there's nothing interesting about her. She constantly runs away, she barely talks, and she's super plain. Last episode, she meets a girl with way more energy than her, and they are probably around the same age too.

For some reason, this anime is highly discussed and well-liked. However, I find it average. The artwork is nothing special but I will compliment that we do not see the colors and style used quite often. For that, I will give it good criticism. Despite having a weird title to it, the story is not bad at all and it keeps you watching. It's nothing too exciting and I am not fully engaged in it all the time (despite me saying it keeps you busy) but that's mostly because I don't care too much about supernatural genre anime. Why am I watching it? To give you a general idea of whether or not you'd like the anime or not. :)

Unfortunately my girlfriend doesn't feel that way about the situation lmfao.

I'd do it again in a heart beat. It's not the first time I've got in the middle of something I didn't need to and it won't be the last. Sure it'd be easy for me to turn the other cheek and act like I didn't see anything, and most people do. But let's take a second and think about how the world would be if everyone did that. Sure some people believe minding your own business is the best route, it'll keep you safe. But what if that's how your local police were? How about firefighters? Our coast guard. I may not be any of those things, but I am human. That should be enough.
A while back I had seen three motorcycles and a pickup truck on the side of the road. I pulled over and flipped on my lights so nobody would hit us, got out to see if I could help as it was obvious there was an accident. Turns out the motorcyclist were speeding and one of them rear ended the pickup truck. The woman driving was hysterical meanwhile the 3 bikers were screaming at her when she did nothing wrong. I tried to calm them down while calling for an ambulance. They started trying to drive off so I took pictures of their license plates so the police had something to go off of for the hit and run. Well one of them tries to grab my phone and we went back and forth a bit before he fled too.
I was scolded for that by friends and family. They said it wasn't my business and I could've been hurt or killed. Well what if it was you or me in that woman's position? What if there were 3 grown men screaming at you threatening you when you did nothing wrong. Personally, I would want someone to stop and help. And that's exactly what I did and what I'll continue to do. Sure one day it might end up biting me in the ass. But I'm willing to risk that if it means I get to help people.

A Fake Credit Card for the Sites (A Dead Prepaid Works Better if you Don't Know Bin Numbers). A Voice Changer, And a Excuse to End the Call.

Anyway Make a Docx Exploit Better if it's A PDF, And Make it Look Official For instance Make it Look Like A Wells Fargo Account Document That States (Insert payment option) Is Allowed by your Bank and the Payment options login Credentials. (Use fake one's).
And Use a Voice Changer and Ask them to Take the File. If the Say No then Say It Would Be Easier for them to Take it While you Call the Bank And Ask them Why Your Login isn't Working. 

After they Take it Ask them to Call Back With in a Hour. When they Call Back answer Using your Real Voice Ask them Who they Are And What they Want. Then Tell them You got A Call from Your Friend at the Bank (Female Name's Work Best) And She Said There that Your Dad Called and they Inquired About the Payment And thought it Was A Scam And Called you And Asked you Too Check on your Dad. And Yell at them And Call them Scammers Hangup and Block the Number.",0,0

4495,59785144,6077689,"   
You can just type ""kik friends"" and download any app available for that matter. That should do the trick for starters.

   
According to people using this method, it's the most effective way to bring HQ traffic to your snapchat. It would be better if you swiped a bit tho so you also get some matches and draw their attention to your bio. Men, tend to spam swipe a lot more than women do (well, duh, obviously).

   
That really depends on what you are trying to achieve. For instance, do you have time to SE them? Answer their spammy questions etc?
If so, then , the possibility of making a sale if you are less direct than that is obviously higher. However, if you don't have time to handle the timewasters for whatever reason, your best bet would be to either be direct about it, or set up an automation method.
Remember, MOST men don't buy because they are horny.
Most men buy because they are lonely.

   
If you are patience enough to build it up, hands down instagram.
If you are not patience enough then it would be Snapchat (obviously).
If you mean, ""What's the best site for that?"" , then my answer is OnlyFans.
It's the most widespear out of all other similar kind of sites and people tend to feel more secure when dealing with someone who is verified on that platform",0,0

- Contact the girl who is in your photo  and pay her a certain amount of money to give you permission to use her photos as you like (this is named Model Release Agreement) but also you need a copy of her ID card (yes, a copy of her ID card to comply with 2257 regulations ). Once you have her agreement, you can act as sale agent in her behalf (you also need another agreement and you will give her a small percentage from each sale). 
Starting from this point it does not matter if you are a guy but you say to your clients that you are a girl - this is considered a marketing strategy, it is legal as long as you represent the commercial interest of your model (no escort things, no giving to your clients false impression that you are open for a relation and so on...)
Depending where you live (but I think it is everywhere in EU) , after you earn a certain amount of money and in case if you earn month by month, you will have to create a company but until you create the company it is enough if you pay the taxes for your income.
It's not that difficult but it is very expensive and maybe the model needs recurring payment for 6 months or 1 year.
One more thing: do not use any pirated software program or pirated script for your website... everything you are using must be genuine.

Today i decided to start posting my journey towards my goal. It should be some sort of diary of my business while it could also serve other people to grow their. Of course i’ll have my little secret to some of my stuff but i’ll be as clear as possible to what i did before and what i do in future. 

                    Background Story

I’ve been ewhoring since a long time. It’s almost 10 years now tbh and i also never really saw the potential in this type of work. It started off with ripping some dudes for DLC packs and Xbox Live Gold. Then i moved on to other games and stuff i wanted but never really left the ewhoring scene. I gained alot of experience during the uncountable chats (and dickpics) but never really saw any use for that. Poor me i never knew how valueable money could be.. Anyways fast forward to the last ~2 years. 

I’ve started to get interested into finances so i wanted to build a business on the side. Dropship didn’t work, Affiliate marketing didn’t work either. Then i came back to HF and went to the ewhoring section to see how the community has been doing. I started the same day to get back into it and started to build my game up. 

I’ve made few thousands but for me that wasn’t enough and not stable at all. I knew to make big bank i need a girl that is lit as fucc, got that potential and a brain that processes your talking.
6 Months and countless threats of pimps later i’ve finally came to a girl that fits my needs. She’s lit and i could convince her... Our journey begins..

                     The Actual Journey

Here we are, starting off with an instagram all casual. After our 1.7k followers we got banned. Mad moment for me cuz i preached money. Anyways i sucked it up and made a new account together with 2 Backups which i’m growing just in case. We got our Onlyfans Paid and Free up and slowly running. Meanwhile our new Instagram is on 6.6k (pain in the ass), hashtag banned and our Backups are on 2.3k / 1.1k. Overall about 7-10k profileviews /day. Our stats looked nice.

Today however it happened, we got banned on 7k followers. Reason: Nudity. FUCC you Instagram, i’ll be back.. We are using our Backup on 2.3k and got a tip of a friend which we will try in ~8 Days. 
Basically the Network that will push us will bring us to 10-15k followers, everything more is awesome. 

Our Onlyfans Free is on 360 fans while our Paid is on 45. Our subscription is $34.99. I don‘t really agree with people who say „go cheap you‘ll sell more.“ I stay premium and it‘s working not bad. Within 2 months my free made ~$1‘000 in tips (which i don’t actively push anymore) and the paid did ~$1‘800 overall.

Overall Stable Income: ~$1‘200 /month

Ill Make this as brief as possible while trying to provide the most clarity as to what i am looking for.

I met a cool guy on here about 18 months back. He was from serbia, i just got a computer at the time and bought myself a seven eleven franchise. It was a 1070 lol, not that it matters. The guy was no pro hacker but i had money and he was more savvy then me. With my funds and his way around computers we didnt do anything sophisticated or major but we had fun, i learned alot, we worked together on certain objectives trusted eachother and both parties were able to benefit from one another. I rented us a dedicated server on cyber bunker who recently got shut down. After that the guy got into a serious relationship with a girl and started to naturally distance himself from the computer. Still a cool guy and were friends but he had his own journey in life. Im no dummy nor am i a atm machine. Im nobody special but theres a reason i made something out my life and its because i use my head. Im not looking for you to think im cool or for your approval but im letting you know im not your crash dummy. However that guy was my friend and we worked TOGETHER key word sometimes i would send him a digital gift card help him out a little, or since we were partners if i got something i usually got two copies so it was a cool beneficial friendship. He would do the research for example right now i am looking for a real different vps being cyberbunker is no longer, ideally he or you would read the tos see if they would have what we need and make sure its worth our money and i would simply pay for it to give you better understanding of what im looking for.

Check out this article.

A few quotes:


 LAKE SCHATZ Wrote:This week, a cache of confidential Lady Gaga files was leaked by a hacker group. Those same cybercriminals are now aiming to bring down Donald Trump.

It all started earlier this week, when Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks, one of the most prominent law firms in the entertainment industry, became the target of a hacker group using ransomware called REvil. The massive cyberattack resulted in over 750 gigabytes of stolen data pertaining to the firm’s A-list clientele, which include Gaga, Bruce Springsteen, Drake, U2, and Madonna, as well as Robert De Niro, Bette Midler, and LeBron James. 
 LAKE SCHATZ Wrote:Considering the REvil hackers have followed through on their threats thus far, it will be interesting to see where the Trump campaign stands a week from today.

How about you do some research before you try to ""debunk"" someone. Despite liberal sources trying to say otherwise federally prosecuting molestation of children 12-17 is ""optional"" as of 2012. Now it is 15-17 apparently.

 Quote:In addition to Mexico City, the age of consent is 12 in the following Mexican states (as of December 2018):

Aquascalientes
Baja California Sur
Guanajuato
Guerrero
Jalisco
Michoacan
Morelos
Oaxaca
Puebla
Sinaloa
Sonora
Tamaulipas
Zacatecas 

   

   


Have you even been to Mexico? They have a HUGE pedophilia problem.

 Quote:At a local level, each Mexican state has its own penal code to prosecute sexual abuses, but none mentions an age of consent, nor explicitly prohibits intimate relationships between adults and minors under 18 years of age. Each state legislation is specific in how it prosecutes those guilty of engaging in sexual relations with minors under 12 who are considered unable to fully understand the meaning of the act.

“Underage minors have to be empowered so that they can be the ones who, at the right age, have agency over their body, their sexuality and procreation,” Martín Pérez assured AFP.  

   

Mexico HARDLY prosecutes these underage marriages.

 Quote:According to the U.N. Women data, 25 percent of Mexican women ages 50 to 54 say they married as children, while 21 percent of women 20 to 24 report the same — a small change over more than a generation.

As for the girl, I think that she's moving on but she's keeping you ""on the hook"" so that she'll always have a backup plan.
I'm not saying she doesn't love you or didn't love you, but I'm saying that she first of all doesn't want to lose you as a person because you make her happy in a way and she enjoys your company but if she wanted something more right now with you, you'd be having it already, I had the same thing with a girl who I dated on and off for about 6 years, I loved her and she did the same thing to me with the whole ""I dunno, not right now, but in the future"", all I know from my experience is... it usually doesn't end well, if you can, my advice is stay friends, and if talking about her new guys bothers you, tell her, let her know you are willing to talk about a lot of stuff but not that.

You are 18. That is the first thing you need to remember and realize.
Old people are not trying to bag on you by saying you are young.

You are young, and going through what is very normal for people your age.
Girls and guys both can't make up their minds, are still figuring themselves out, what they want etc.
Everything feels so important, like this is your one chance to get it right, your one true love etc.

Do you want to fall in Love and get married at 20? 
If so, then sure, keep on like you are, it MIGHT happen, but remember it might not, and it could just be hard, and painful, and that's normal.

Do you want to have fun in life? learn yourself? learn about others? have a real, full relationship?

Qur'an verse 22:40  Quote:[They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, ""Our Lord is Allah ."" And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might. 

Qur'an verse Al-Haj 22:39  Quote:Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory. 

I agree killing is inhumane, but you are missing some of the keypoints of Islam, the right to defend yourself is allowed and there are verses and conditions for each circumstance that are countable. The countries that were overtaken by the muslim conquests back then would rather prefer not being slaughtered by the romans and was then peacefully being conquered under some circumstances, whilst others was with fighting etc. Keep in mind that during the Roman empire times people were treated like bs as slaves, they were setup in fighting arenas with animals and other fighters with people betting on them, and they were then being kept in cages with very low access to food and water, the women were most likely sold to brothels or wealthy farm owners. The Quranic verses would forbid most of those actions taking place under the Islamic empire, and that's why some countries surrendered. I can't say that was countable for every region within the empire as you have to keep in mind that Islam was still fairly new at that point of time, and only the traditions were being held.",0,0
4577,59774098,6077154,"First of I actually speak Arabic fluently.

second of there are some points you can't deny.

Jihad
""it can refer to almost any effort to make personal and social life conform with God's guidance, such as struggle against one's evil inclinations, proselytizing, or efforts toward the moral betterment of the ummah,""
   


Jizya
""Jizya or Jizyah is a per capita yearly taxation historically levied in the form of financial charge on permanent non-Muslim subjects of a state governed by Islamic law in order to fund public expenditures of the state, in place of the Zakat and Khums that Muslims are obliged to pay""

   

So basically any none Muslim living in a Muslim country MUST PAY, LEAVE WITHOUT TAKING ANYTHING INCLUDING CLOTHES AND IDs, OR CONVERT UNWILLINGLY.

that being said, that's what ISIS exactly did to my people. Now over 700k families are homeless because of Jizya and Jihad and for that any good thing in Islam can not fix the picture of the religion.

not to mention it's okay to take their girls and make them their wife's ""Odalisque (جارية)""

Whatever ISIS did is exactly what the Qur'an says and if you deny that you are denying your religion.

4578,59774774,6077154,"   
You are comparing a country to a religion. 
A religion that says you either pay or get punished, the punishment can be death at some cases. So is it okay for a religion to punish people that don't believe in it ?
Again, don't compare other religions or countries. 
As for Zakat, nobody really does that. When i was Muslim, non of my family, relatives, or friends pay Zakat and if you don't pay no one will punish you for it but if you don't Jizya then you get punished.


So what did ISIS do ?
took over a country that is not Muslim just like Early Muslim conquests.
What did they do ? Ask to pay Jizya, convert, leave, or die.
What happened if you didn't pay, convert, or leave ? any girl in the family was taken as Odalisque, men were killed.

So did ISIS do exactly as you were saying ? Yes",0,0
4579,59774339,6077154,"   
Apparently you do not speak Arabic. ""قاتلوا"" means fight. It does not mean kill. In this instance, this can be attributed to resistance against other religions. Verse 2:256 says ""There is no compulsion in religion."" Any act of forcing someone to believe a certain way religiously is not religion. However, the Bible clearly states otherwise. 

“Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be killed. (Exodus 22:19)

“Everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. (2 Chronicles 15:12-13)“

“If your own full brother, or your son or daughter, or your beloved wife, or your intimate friend, entices you secretly to serve other gods, whom you and your fathers have not known, gods of any other nations, near at hand or far away, from one end of the earth to the other: do not yield to him or listen to him, nor look with pity upon him, to spare or shield him, but kill him. Your hand shall be the first raised to slay him; the rest of the people shall join in with you. You shall stone him to death. (Deuteronomy 13:7-12)

4580,59781224,6077154,"   This thread is about understanding Islam that is the title of this thread. What he mentioned are in authentic hadiths. If you reject hadith then you reject the Quran.

Regarding gay people this is what Muhammad ordered:
Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:

The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If you find anyone doing as Lot's people did, kill the one who does it, and the one to whom it is done. 

Correct stoning as a punishment is not mentioned in the Quran however flogging is you are to receive 100 lashes. 24:2

Female genital mutilation is in authentic hadiths where Muhammad says it is honorable. 

The Quran does mentions disbelievers, that is anyone who is not a Muslim, this includes atheists. 

Quran 8:12 When your Lord revealed to the angels: I am with you, therefore make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.

Hadith Sunan an-Nasa'i Grade: Sahih 
It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that :

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""I have been commanded to fight the idolators until they bear witness to La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship except Allah) and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

Sahih Bukhari ""Narrated Abu Huraira:

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings, and I have been made victorious with terror, and while I was sleeping, the keys of the treasures of the world were brought to me and put in my hand."" Abu Huraira added: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has left the world and now you, people, are bringing out those treasures (i.e. the Prophet did not benefit by them).""

Your Allah calls non muslims the worst of creatures. 

Indeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. Those are the worst of creatures.

Zakat: Show me a Muslim punished for not paying Zakat  ??? because i can show you people punished for not paying Jizya.


Yes, im bringing ISIS because in Iraq thousands of families are now homeless because ISIS gave them a choice to convert, leave without taking anything, or be killed.
Tho ISIS did bring children but that's to train them to be an army.

Murdering innocents: it's acceptable if not paying Jizya which is what they did

Forced conversions: They were given a choice where u either leave everything, convert or get killed so some just couldn't leave and had to convert and that's a way of forcing people.

Oppression of women: Non Muslims were forced to wear Hijab.

You are not getting the point ...

 
What are the punishment for leaving Islam ? Kill them, so now you should kill me cuz i was Muslim once!!!
إذا ارتد مسلمٌ ، وكان مستوفياً لشروط الردة – بحيث كان عاقلاً بالغاً مختاراً -  أُهدر دمه ، ويقتله الإمام – حاكم المسلمين – أو نائبه – كالقاضي – ولا يُغسَّل ولا يُصلى عليه ولا يُدفن مع المسلمين .

يكفر إلا الحج لا يكفر بتأخيره بحال، فمن ارتد عن الإسلام من الرجال والنساء وهو بالغ عاقل دُعي إليه ثلاثة أيام وضيق عليه، فإن لم يتُب قُتل.

I'm still not fully sure what the fugg she's talking about, she also kept saying ""my iris is your iris"".

Does anyone know how to get into contact with him? I'm genuinely wondering if this dude is alright. I know he was never super active but he was a member since 2016. I am personally over 4 years clean off of heroin. When I was active in the ""recovery"" community I personally knew like 5 guys and like 3 girls who died. It honestly wouldn't surprise me if this guy died or his life spiraled downward and he no longer checks HF.

Of course, most likely a simple explanation is he just forgot to login, still.. If he wasn't lying or exaggerating his daily opiate use, my theories are not a stretch. Does anyone know how to contact him?

I am a customer of Linyah's and honestly I have nothing but good things to say so far. 

Seller has responded to every query/comment of mine, the quality of the ebook is SOLID and while everyone knows the generalities of ewhoring, there is some great ""private"" info included inside the guide, and is a great vault of information for any beginners/newbies to ewhoring. 
Honestly, you can probably get 25-50% of the info online for free if you REALLY searched long and hard for good HQ guides (this is just the nature of ewhoring and can't be helped, the basics of pretending to be a female to milk sugardaddies is a common theme shared by all ebooks), however the buy is definitely worth it. 

For 30 USD, Linyah provides AMAZING support (more than I can say for most ebook sellers on HF), some private methods/sections of the guide with big earning potential, and a condensation of all of the necessary/important info that one may have a headache finding. Put that all into one place, and that 30 dollars is a good investment. 

So far, the community is rather small, just me and Linyah, but over time, I can see the potential for it becoming a great resource as well, there are already great free resources like packs, android live snap apk, examples/templates to use, and me and Linyah have already discussed about things like how to improve on getting traffic, etc. The more the merrier however, and this can only improve over time. 

I highly recommend this guide over other ewhore guides, especially for those that aren't looking to pay a king's ransom for a ebook just to be disappointed. Cheap doesn't mean bad quality necessarily, and this seller is one of those gems in the rough.

4621,59808282,6079916,"How far would you go to find out the truth?

My friend , lets call him Jack, has a big dilemma: “penetrate or not penetrate? ” 
Ok, we call it penetration testing, so in plain English this would sound like : Hack her or not to hack her?
He is talking about his ex girlfriend .He is still seeing her for casual and low cost penetration  and to keep her in the loop , for example in case he decide to  penetrate test her.
What is his reason? Simple: the poor kitten spent  4 years with this woman and the first 1 year was amazing as he  describe it. Then He started to see signs of lies and find evidence of  lying and cheating what the woman admit it back then. She promised that was an only one  so Jack believed her because he wanted to.
Jack has  some business to run what not really on the list of legal businesses in his country and because he was pussywhacked  he  wasn’t too wise to hide it from the woman. 
So, long story in short: the woman has some compromising material against him somewhere on the cloud or on her laptop or phone what can put my friend Jack  behind bars. 
The woman still saying she loves him
Jack still see sign of another man in the woman’s life what she  rejects completely 
Jack doesn’t want to leave this half-relationship without he can be sure about his assumptions and check those signs out. He doesn’t want to leave her based of assumptions, he wants to know for sure .

And here coming the real question:  how far would you go to find out the truth?
Hacking someone personal laptop and/or phone  is definitely invading the privacy of the person. 
BUT: Jack says, he has the right to make an informed decision what to do with  any woman. 
He may want to marry her or he just want to know if she worth it to pay her bills in a relationship, he wants to know if she is loyal and trustworthy enough to work for her and even to have a plan with her for the future..

We all know there is a thin line  between white hat and black hat.
We should respect the privacy of others.
Do we have the right to know relevant information of a relationship?
Do we have the right to know any information of our relationship?

Which one is the stronger argument? 
1/ The right to know what is included Jack, so He can make an informed decision about his future?
2/ The right of privacy of the woman , who may be a pro scammer with the  hairy checkbook (pussy)  ?

On the law side Jack cant follow or lurk her.  Its illegal. 
Jack cant record and listen conversation of hers with any other party. Illegal
Jack can’t do Jakcs's something that like is sorta but not yet poop because its illegal.

Are we agree on the fact what's  says Jack just has to cope and marry the woman because the only legal option for him??

Without advertising nobody knows anything about you, write on your car something like  ""I'm selling nudes, snapchat xxxxxxx"" and drive in your town, pay advertising on your local newspaper, give flyers /visit cards to people in your town, purchase advertising spots on local radio and TV..... or create a website that looks like the personal website of your girl model , than create accounts on Onlyfans, manyvids, diferent porn sites, Instagram, Tinder (even facebook), create a skype profile... just do a google search and create profiles everywhere even on cam sites.

If you have bad hygiene, or you have poor social skills, or you lack a certain sense of self awareness that makes you off putting, you would still fail.

Serbian girls again, according to my experience, love Greeks when they come to vacation so if you are a tourist from another place that want to hit on Serbs, don’t bother.

4716,59837039,6082409,"I can see several posts including OPs where you are all basing off on speculations and assumptions. It is true that there isn't any evidence that this was done out of racism. However,  you need to understand that police brutality in America is a very common thing where they give harsher and more brutal treatment towards blacks. In the same city a white man was wielding a knife and telling the police to fugg off, he was not tazed nor had a knee upon his neck. You obviously cannot compare one case with another and make a statement on how blacks are treated worse than whites. Which is why you look at multiple cases and compare how both the white and black suspects was treated. Only then will you begin to see a trend. 

Not all police are bad, I used to watch alot of police stuff and some are very respectful and commit to their jobs professionally. In America however, there is a large portion of the police that are unprofessional and take pleasure in abusing their power. Its basic psychology, when placed in a position of power and trust people tend to abuse it. What doesn't help is the judical system in America is fugged. We often see blacks get longer sentences than whites. The two white guys who gunned down an innocent black jogger named Ahmed were only given minimal sentences. So its not just some of the police that exhibit racism but also some judges.

We can speculate all day whether this was done out of racism or not, there isnt any evidence of racism nor any evidence that this wasn't racism. So I agree with you on that OP. Mainstream media always likes to push a narrative where blacks are the ones who are being mistreated and always the victims. It was not long ago a black guy was abusing and punching an innocent white 70 year old,  the mainstream media failed to cover this as it went against their narrative.. So to conclude, we cannot trust the media nor can we assume or speculate unless substantial evidence is put forward. I can understand however why some people believe it was done out of racism, because like I said there are thousands of cases in America of police brutality against african americans.

Would also like to add that there was also another incident that occcured where a white female named Amy Cooper called the police on a black bystander who simply asked her to leash her dog.

I’m not criticising you, it’s completely upto you to make the major decisions that will effect your future.

I just think it’s a bit rich you’re moaning about money that you effectively defrauded someone out of.

Furthermore, your argument about it being the girls’ choice to take nudes is really irrelevant. The problem isn’t so much that you’re using their pictures, it’s that you’re defrauding men. Don’t pull out the old “they’re getting what they paid for” shit either, because they’re not. If that’s the case, tell them you’re a 16 year old virgin sitting in your mother’s basement selling girls photos.

Nobody ever thinks they’re going to be the one that is arrested. But a quick search on Google will give you some examples of young lads even getting jail time for it.

It is a fraud, you are right. Identity theft in particular. Everybody takes decisions, right ? It's not my fault that a girl took nudes and now they are around the web. Take a porn actress for ex. Lana Rhoades, how many discord or steam accounts have you seen using Lana Rhoades as a profile picture. There are a lot of them for sure. They never got a permission from her to use them so it can still be defined as identity theft. But nobody is actually gonna get arrested for using them. Think that way.",0,0

4756,59983644,6094056,"   Do you think that police will not take any action if we are talking about $20 or $50 ? You are wrong! A thief is named a thief even if he steal $10 or $100k and the goal of the authorities is to catch ""all the thieves"" not to catch only the thieves who are stealing a certain amount of money and ignore the small thieves. 

This is what I wrote a few months ago in regard with consequences of e-whoring in case if you are caught:

1 - do you pay taxes for the money you get by selling photos/videos? - NO? this is TAX EVASION

2 - do you offer receipt / invoice for the product you sell? - NO? this is ""black money"" so we can talk about MONEY LAUNDERING
If you say YES to above question than answer the next question:
It is printed your real name (or your company name) on the invoice? NO? It is definitely money laundering

3 - do you collect the money into a Paypal/AGC account (or any similar website) and the account is NOT registered with your real name + real home address? -YES ? this is money laundering and it could be even identity theft

4 - you are not the girl from the photo/video but you claim that you are indeed that person without having the girl's consent? YES? - this is fraud/misrepresentation and identity theft.

5 - do you have a signed contract or at least an online agreement with the model from the photo that you are allowed to sell the products? -NO? This is COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT because you are using their images for commercial purposes.

6 - can you prove that the model from your photo/video is 18+ yo? (Do not say that she has big boobs or it is clear that she is 18+ because she looks mature but.... do you have a copy of her ID card or passport)? -NO? Well.. maybe the model is not even 18 and you modified the child from the photo in photoshop to look older! After expertise and in case if only 1 photo was modified with photoshop (maybe you resized or crop the image) you need a very good lawyer to not get charged with ""possession and distribution of child pornography""

7 - maybe the model from your photo was identified (you hope you will not get charged with child pornography) but.... the model can sue you for copyright infringement + emotional distress , it will be a long and expensive civil case

8 - Identity theft = using photos/videos to pose as someone you are not for the purpose of deceiving your clients into giving you money is IDENTITY THEFT

9 - Obtain financial advantage by deception/FRAUD 

As long as you play fair (no scamming) it is no way for you of getting caught as long as does not exist any complaint against you. 
It is good to hide your ip address because your clients will never know where are you from but do not believe that authorities can not find you (this is another chapter to explain when and how they can do this)",0,0

This is a good thing, as the app is based around pictures when eWhoring itself is mostly about sending pictures. Although it is harder to find buyers on Snapchat as it is much harder to keep the conversation going.


to get started on Snapchat, you will need Bluestacks

You will at least need 2GB of RAM just for Bluestacks to run!




Once done, install Snapchat on the Bluestacks play store. Be sure to make a sexy girl account, but make it look somewhat innocent. Do not put nudes as your profile picture. When this is done, find a PFP and look at more methods to learn tips and tricks. try adding people and getting their attention to buy your nudes if you have tons of people added you can make post like wanna see my nudes cash app me or hit me up and when they hit you up ask them for money.

The downfall of this method is that very little people want to buy your nudes on Snapchat.

Tinder for traffic, I have meetups for $100/hr with a 30-40$ deposit which ""ensures my time wont be wasted"". They usually agree to it since it is a service and I tell them I've had my time wasted too many times so I require it before I get ready. I have a verification pic ready for a live snap as well so they usually bite fairly often. For me it's a numbers game, I have 2-3 girls I use and 2-3 Snapchats I run. I use textverified to buy 3 phone verifications (one for each girl) and I usually get 80-100 requests, More on fridays/weekends. Always make at least 200-300 per number.

The second type is the ""instagram model' or attention whore. You know the type. They're always posting thirst traps on social media. Most of them just crave attention and they aren't making money. If you approach them with a good offer, they might accept it. 

Either way, you will need a good reason for them to sell to you. When Craigslist and Backpage had adult advertising, I used to tell prospects that I used the pics for advertising. You will need to come up with your own story. 

Coronavirus has made morals a little to expensive for some women. That gives you a better chance of making this work. And it gives you a chance to work on your sales skills. If you can get a woman to sell you those pics, you can get a man to buy them.",0,0

How would you go about doing this exactly?

Like would you just contact the girl and go for it right off the bat telling her something like ""I'll pay you x amount of money to send me x amount of videos and pictures""? (I personally feel this would come off as super creepy no matter how I try to flip it in my head)

4809,59897629,6087480,"Hi,

Let me tell you a short story.
I am a simple independent girl who graduated University in IT. I worked as a front-end developer for a small IT company until last week. But, due to COVID-19 crisis, all our clients closed their contracts and we've got fired. On the local market it is a bit hard to get hired right now and I am looking for alternatives.

Scrolling on instagram on a profile, I could check a follower which has an only-fans account and seems to earn a lot of money, becoming her's principal revenue.
Since I am a busty girl, I am thinking to do the same in order to earn some quick money. My only concern is privacy. I've signed up for an only-fans account sending my ID and my photo to become verified. Now I have some questions since I am not willing to provide my face as these pictures can get public audience and can harm me in the future.

1 - How safe is only-fans? I am ok with sending face photos for getting verified, but can users get my real identity?
2 - What other legit websites can you suggest on which I can sell my photos?
3 - How do I advertise / promote myself ? I know from old post about omegle, fiverr, etc. I think these are somehow outdated, are there any new things?",0,0

Gay ewhoring works but you can't treat it like regular ewhoring. You have to look at it as more of a sugar daddy/sugar baby thing. The older guys want attention. The only difference is that they want it from men instead of women.  You have to play the long game - lots of talking before getting to the subject of money.

Dear Ms. Pussylips

I’m writing to apply for the Fashion Model position with your agency. I have ten years of modelling experience with a wide variety of clientele and campaigns. Currently as a fashion model I am spending the majority of my time working on a magazine layout for a major cosmetics brand.

My versatility lends itself well to various modelling needs. I am a high-energy model who strives to maintain a positive attitude and freshness throughout long shoots which I believe is an asset for anyone in this industry. I possess a unique look that stands out from the crowd but I can adapt to various moods and styles. Previous employers have praised me for my work ethic and positive attitude as well as for my modelling performance. I’m confident I can meet your needs on this campaign and that I can deliver the dramatic look you’re after.

My head shot and credentials as a fashion model speak for themselves. However I would love to meet with you in person to demonstrate my fit for this position. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email and I thank you for your time.

PS FILL OUT BELOW DOC

4843,59870861,6085329,"So this happened about a month ago. There's a woman at the dog park I frequently visit named Kathy, and on my walk home, I saw an ambulance outside of her apartment complex and I saw her being wheeled up to it on a stretcher. After crossing the street, I caught her just before she was getting loaded in. She could barely talk, but told me to talk to Katie (her manager) to find out what happened. She had surgery about a week prior (nerve damage that was affecting her legs/feet), and the incision on the back of her neck had gotten infected and she started coughing up blood. I gave Katie my number, and told her to call me if she needed help with the dog or if Kathy needed anything. Three hours later, I get a call from Kathy, and she asked if I would be willing to Uber her from the hospital to her home. I drove for uber for a while, so she wanted to pay me to take her home. I declined the payment, drove to the hospital, helped wheel her out to my car, took her home, and had Katie watch her while I took my dog and Kathy's to the dog park since she didn't make it there earlier. 

When I first met her two years ago, I didn't have a dog. She was walking hers down the road and told me I looked like the type of guy that needed a dog in his life. We talked for a bit and I went on my way. Two weeks later, my girlfriend and I split, and I went out and got myself a dog. She's the reason I thought to do that, and if it weren't for her, I wouldn't have the good ole' boy I have today.

In what world do you live in where the police aren't justified in defending themselves with lethal force? Who tf wants to be a police officer if you can be charged with murder for defending yourself in accordance with the law? This is a ridiculous thing to believe. Jesus.

 Quote:A 2015 video clip has surfaced of an interview with Black Lives Matter founder Patrisse Cullors in which she assures her interviewer that the group has an underlying ideology, saying, ""We're trained Marxists.""

Responding to the interviewer's concern that the BLM movement might not have enough of a ""clear ideological structure,"" Cullors responded by saying that she and another co-founder ""in particular"" are dedicated to the ideology of Communist leader Karl Marx:

""We actually do have an ideological frame. Myself and Alicia in particular, we're trained organizers. We are trained Marxists. We are super versed on ideological theories.""

Alicia, whom Cullors mentioned, is Alicia Garza. Garza, Cullors, and a third woman, Opal Tometi, founded Black Lives Matter together.

🔦 Many opponents of BLM have been calling the group Marxist, or ""neo-Marxist,"" or ""cultural Marxists,"" since it came to prominence, due to its heavy focus on group identity and class conflict.

BLM's website lists many far-left ideals in its list of core beliefs.

Spoiler  (Click to View)  
 Quote:Merriam-Webster is revising its entry on racism after a recent college graduate in Missouri, inspired by the protests and debates about what it means to be racist, urged editors to make changes.

Currently, the dictionary’s entry contains three sections. The first defines racism as “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.”

The second calls it a “doctrine or political program based on the assumption of racism and designed to execute its principles” and “a political or social system founded on racism.” The third section refers to “racial prejudice or discrimination.”

Peter Sokolowski, an editor at large at Merriam-Webster, said in an interview Wednesday that editors were working to revise the online entry for racism after the recent graduate, Kennedy Mitchum, wrote a series of emails stating her case.

“This entry has not been revised in decades,” he said, adding that it was not a new division of the word’s meanings, “but an improvement of the wording.”

As a student at Drake University in Des Moines, Ms. Mitchum had noticed in discussions about racism that white people sometimes defended their arguments by cutting and pasting the definition from the dictionary.

Thanks for reading The Times.

So in late May, as protests against racism and police violence grew, Ms. Mitchum, 22, wrote to the editors at Merriam-Webster to argue that the entry should be revised to better reflect how systemic racism was in society.

About a year later I found out she did very much like me, but didn't move forward with anything because when I would get angry I'd go into the kitchen freezer and punch shit to get my anger out. VERY smart on her part, and I'm glad she indirectly (yet directly) taught me a life altering lesson by thinking before acting.
