5004,59864606,6084746," Gay teacher : So about a year ago we had to do a speech about something we were passionate about. These would then be recorded to put on the school website. I decided to do one about gay rights as it was not yet legalized in my state. I decided to mention that I was gay during the speech, which wasn‚Äôt that much of a surprise to people. In the end it went really well.

Then a couple of hours later, during lunch I was walking past the staffroom to get to the lunch hall when I heard my speech being played, being curious I stopped and I heard them replay ‚ÄúI am gay myself actually‚Äù a couple of times over. Out of the corner I could see my 6th grade teacher give my computer studies teacher 10 dollars. Then suddenly, I sneezed really loudly, the teachers turned around and saw me standing there.

My 6th grade teacher has pretty much gotten over it but my computer studies teacher refuses to make eye contact with me.

 : When I was in high school, I was pretty quiet around people who weren‚Äôt my friends. The high school‚Äôs wrestling coach also taught geometry, and he was my teacher. This resulted in a lot of wrestlers skipping class and barging into our classroom to hang out and not get in trouble. One day, seven wrestlers come in yelling about new wrestling uniforms, and how excited they were. When they go over and pull out the uniforms, the whole class is kind of side eyeing them. Even without what I mention next, the suits look funny. I mean, it‚Äôs tight royal blue Spandex with a suspender style top. Absolutely funny already. But the wrestlers grab the uniforms and rush out of the room to go change in the bathroom, and come back to show them off. Which, is also hysterical because Spandex hides NOTHING; you could see all of their junk.

Anyway, we live in a town called Ocean City. It‚Äôs commonly abbreviated as ‚ÄúOC‚Äù. On the back of the Spandex uniform, it says Ocean City Men in large letters. Except‚Ä¶ they used the abbreviation. On the back, it says OC MEN. Which isn‚Äôt awful, but then I sound it out in my head. OC MEN. Oh‚Äîsemen. I almost spit out the water I was drinking.

I looked around frantically, trying to find out who I can tell, because I didn‚Äôt have any friends to tell in this class. I turn to the girl next to me, and I had no idea who she was and had never talked to her before. I told her what I found and we both cracked up.

The whole time she saw me as the quiet teacher‚Äôs pet who was shy as hell. The first words out of my mouth were ‚ÄúIt says oh semen.‚Äù

So, I guess I can kinda speak to this part?

While my wife was pregnant(1st) she constantly lost weight due to not eating. Once you get closer to the due date it‚Äôs pretty much 1 appointment a week with the obgyn at least for us. 

At every appointment she would lose more and more(prior to the uptick in obgyn visits). We ended up going to her primer as she had lost 20 pounds LIKE HOW? She refused to eat mostly and it didn‚Äôt help that her friends kept saying ‚ÄúOMG YOU LOOK AMAZING‚Äù ‚ÄúHOW CAN YOU BE PREGNANT AND LOOK SO GREAT‚Äù feeding into her eating even less.

Well, I ended up in a situation 1 on 1 with the Dr and brought up pot as a choice as we smoked prior to the pregnancy.

Thanks for your reply. Why would you be against the halal butchering of animals, if it proves one of the most humane methods available for butchering animals? It also provides a ""cleaner"" meat, and I wouldn't see why you'd be against it. For example, a non-halal method of butchering an animal is through anal electrocution (banned in some countries). This isn't halal as the blood isn't drained from the animal and is also very unsettling and painful for the animal. Circumcision is also done by not just Muslims but between 76 and 92% of the US, the population is circumcised.

Inbreeding is haram (not permissible). Rape is, of course, haram. Slavery is also haram. Slavery was already being practiced in pre-Islamic Arabia. Slavery has never been endorsed by Islamic texts. These no-go zones in Europe, can you please tell me where they are? The people that do these sorts of things are NOT Muslims. Not everyone that comes from the Middle-East is Muslim, and I believe this is hard for some people to understand because of all the things they see on the media.

The one thing I can agree with you is that women are literally not even recognized as objects in SOME Muslim countries. It really disgusts me because the men that treat women like shit, still call themselves Muslim, even though the Quran, of course, says that treating your wife/ any women and make them feel less worth, is not permissible. You see a lot of this happens is Saudi Arabia. 

I hope you understand that most of the true Muslim population hate to see our religion being portrayed as some corrupt religion, often described as a cult, due to what they see on the media.

Thanks for your reply. Islam does not control women. In the Quran, overall, women have more to say/rights than men. It is haram (not permissible) to for example beat your wife (like many people mention that in Islam it is). The media puts it out as though women are treated like shit in Islam, even though these men that treat their women like shit exist everywhere whether religious or not. Stoning is also not mentioned in the Quran as any sort of punishment. There are many other false interpretations of the Quran because it cannot be simply translated from Arabic to any other language. The so-called ""Muslims"" / ""Extremists"" don't even follow the Quran and are far from being ""Muslims"".",0,0

I am unsettled by the history of Islam and some passages of the Quroan. Also the hadiths do not help, issued by some Imams.
I am for the reformation of the Quoran, although not a muslim myself.

I am also against Sharia Law, and halal butchering of animals. Also circumcision.

To be quite frank, there are intelligent muslims, and I have met quite a few of them. But as a group, especially in some countries the inbreeding has reduced general intelligence and genetic fitness to a degree that they will be unable to get back. Where a population is already 40% or more inbred, they are pretty much as ruined. Imagine 70+ %.

Many don't know that the Holy Wars were mainly orchestrated by Christianity to beat back the Muslim invaders from Europe, which they achieved finally in the year 1492. Many castles have been built in Europe due to the slave and marauding routes established by invading Muslims, even up to the coasts of Ireland. A very good book on this is Thomas Pellow's story.

Al Andaluse, was unfortunately not a hub of great scientific progression. Due to their ideology, many sciences did not age well, so to speak, in the Muslim world. You can see the remains of these invading populations genetically in the lower mediterranian regions of Italy and Spain mostly.

The Islamic / Arab slave trade was magnitudes greater than any other group enslaving peoples. It lasted from approximately the creation of Islam to the 19th century. Africans have played a great role as slaves in this trade, and were treated by animals in all manners. Eunuchs were made of them (and of other slaves like Indians, Europeans etc.), which caused most men to die bleeding out. A horrible and painful death indeed.
To this comes the systematic raping of all women, even of children in the occupied territories. In Muslim countries women are barely recognised as animals or objects. People still get stoned, or murdered, or mass-raped. 

In Europe due to the ""refugee crisis"" Africans and Muslims (Middle-Easterners) have poured into the continent. Suddenly, we see a spike in common behaviour from their respective countries such as rape / group-rape, brutal murders and victimization of those that are not like them. There are literal no-go zones in Europe because the Muslim populace will at least beat the shit out of you, or worse.

And people dare to say ""diversity is our strength"" or ""multiculti is great"". Yeah, I know clever and intelligent muslims and blacks, and neitheror any of them say this. Also realise, that some people do not like to live with their own people, due to the reasons above, and reasons discussed around black crime.

How can rape be permitted if the woman is not Muslim? Sex before marriage is not permitted so tell me how rape to a non-muslim is permitted? First cousin marriage is permitted but not encouraged. Slavery is not permitted in Islam full stop. Pretty much everything you said is permitted in Islam isn't permitted at all. If all 1.8 billion of us REAL Muslims (rapidly growing) are rapists, murders, slave owners, and inbreeding, I'm sure we would have killed the whole non-muslim population. These rape gangs have nothing to do with the people who truly believe in Islam. You're directly linking, a religion of peace with 1.8 billion followers to rape gangs and inbreeding (inbreeding happens to lack of education and not because the Quran says it's permissible to have sex with close relatives). Christians being ""hunted"" while Immigrants(most being Muslim) in France are being thrown into camps to be ""processed"".

Everything you're saying IS permissible, IS NOT permissible, and the proof for that is in the Quran itself. The people doing these things are NOT Muslims. You can say what you want but that is a fact. 

I know you don't care about the actual ideology and I'm happy you respect my opinion, and I respect yours too. However, what you know about Islam is wrong, or what you think you know is false.

You are missing the main point my friend. There are trends and behaviours to the Islamic or Muslim community which are prevalent, not mattering that they are permissible or not. Also it matters what fathwas are stated by the Imams. For example saying ""breed out the non-belivers, put children into their women's stomach"" seems like a pretty aggressive thing for me to hear. Also don't forget that ""radical Islam"" spreads in Mosques. Especially if the Muslims are trying to elevate themselves to the ""life of the prophet"". 

If you and the west holds all whites to the same standard, then every group and those individuals can be held to the same standards as well. Furthermore a country being 70% and even 40 or 30% inbred is a pretty big number. What about the Sharia patrols in western cities? Sounds peaceful as hell huh? Or the rape of children? Such peace!

What about the subjugated in the Middle-East, or the disappearance of nearly every non-Muslim religion due to force and subjugation over time?

Lel muh religion of peace argument and the silent majority argument again and again. Care to explain why the silent majority does not do shit when people are murdered, stoned and raped? Or when muslims want Sharia law in countries where democracy rules right now?

What is permissible only matters in so-far as the in and outgroup is concerned.

What in the world are you talking about? Black populations have never received reparations. And it doesn't matter if it was a 100 years ago or 50 years ago. It demonstrates a history of keeping a group of people marginalized and oppressed. This wasn't even the worst one. 

The War On Drugs was in the 70s, you still have people living from that era today. It was an excuse for police to mass incarcerate minorities on drug charges so they could artificially raise prison labor profits. Nobody even cared until the opioid ""crisis"".

Just 30 years before that Japanese internment ravaged an entire group of Asian people who had their legally own property stripped away and supreme court justices claiming they will steal white women.

A thought did just go through my mind...
Not the greatest/easiest... but possibly something to consider.

Maybe the systemic/institutional racism ""Built into the structure"" of laws/jobs/our country... 
Maybe that is gone as far as policies and procedures... but whats holding that still in place is the gray area...

The fact that bias people are still in positions of power, such as the person you interview at a job with.
So you go to interview, and you get someone who is bias, they can get into that gray area and still deny you a job based on race... but they can say it's for any reason...

I think the problem why people have a difficult time with systemic/institutional racism is that it's not actually the system or institutions anymore...
But it is still the people in power/control at those institutions... and even more importantly...  it's still those people in positions of power in politics.

I'm trying to think of a law in place, that seems racist or bias... and I'm starting to wonder if they are right about us having removed most if not all of those... (at least here in California, I dunno other state laws well enough)
If not, someone should compile a list of these, so we know what to actually fight.... but right now.. I'm starting to lean towards: It's just terrible individuals in power.

I think it causes the same effect, I think the many links on the subject, like the Ben and Jerry's one are definitely accurate, just maybe the cause behind it is more complicated.


This is a more difficult problem that involves changing people individual bias.

Could be wrong as I don't know all the facts.

Rioting I feel is a topic where one side believes rioting in moderation and targeting specific buildings or organizations helps their cause as it demonstrates how far protestors are willing to go to exert change into their country. However, targeting buildings such as black owned businesses and Target which has not been intertwined with racial discrimination from what I believe is just completely out of line and insignificant, and only brings down the cause.

Harris criticized the police officer who killed George Floyd.

However, these riots are not helping the protesters.

""When a cops goes hands on a person in an attempt to control his movement or make an arrest, that person's resistance poses a problem that most people don't seem to understand. If you haven't studied this topic, if you don't know what it physically takes to restrain and mobilize a non-compliant person who may be bigger and stronger than you are, and if you haven't thought through the implications of having a gun on your belt when attempting to do that, a gun that can be grabbed and used against you, or against a member of the public, then you intuition about what makes sense here, tactically and ethically are very likely to be bad."" - Sam Harris

These riots are in fact drifting more and more moderates towards Trump. I am one of them admitting it even thought I didn't like Trump very much in the beginning. Some might not even admit it but when they're alone in a voting booth, they will vote for Trump.

There are people getting fired for saying ""All Lives Matter"". How is that racism? Why are they getting fired?

5057,59895576,6087200,"In the past few years, I've begun to realize how, despite what I was raised to believe, religion in general (regardless of exactly what religion) is meant to provide a community some way to come together, or unite in some way. It's just another medium to form some congregation around.

Long story short, I spent most of my childhood attending the sort of new-age-esque Christian churches. By that I mean the ones that incorporate newer music elements and instruments into the existing, age-old hymns. I don't particularly care for that nowadays, and at the time I really didn't. I've never been a consistent church-goer. I might go on Sunday maybe once a month, usually on a whim where I have some thought pop into my head telling myself ""I think I'll head over there and see how everyone's doing"". It was and still is a small town and an even smaller church family. Granted, I am the youngest person there by 30 years, but I enjoy it. There's no electric guitar bullshit, no drum sets. Just the same pianist lady, our preacher, and the maybe 20 people that attend including myself. I enjoy that simplistic harmony of a single piano and everyone's voices more than a rock band drowning out everything else. The music by itself is I think what most drew me away from those churches I used to attend when I was young.

Along with that realization came many others in just two or three years. But keeping the scope to Christianity in general, I don't particularly care for the forced implication of ethics about anything when being put alongside any religion. That, to me, is a no-no. That just turns the gathering into another medium to sway people into any direction you choose. And the debate of which religion is ""right"" has always remained well above my head because in the case my religious experiences are ""wrong"", say Catholicism is the ""right"" or ""only"" religion, I reckon I'm gonna spend 50,000 years in Purgatory before I get into Heaven. Using a chosen religion as backing for something to be ""ethical"" is ridiculous. And, believe it or not, that occasionally comes up at my church. I just choose to go there rather than anywhere else because it comes up the least often there, lol.

And I think the whole PragerU deal is kind of out of whack for my perspective. As I recall, their videos are often fairly sensible and the few that I've actually watched (as a YouTube advertisement, yeah one of the only that I don't immediately skip) the speakers didn't seem to pass anything too forcibly, unlike many, many other videos I've seen even outside of advertisements.

I don't consider myself a ""believer"" because from what I'm told that implies I have zero doubt of what all this is. The ""all this"" being this world that we're in.

Anyways, I still disagree with yours and MW's definition and from personal experience living in the US it's definitely not used as slur there. It's a very rarely used word, but the only time it is used is by someone messing around with a fake British accent or some people that want to be special and not use the common insults. It also doesn't help that the definition you took from is an ELL/ESL definition aimed to help non-native English speakers understand the context of the word.

Besides kitten, would you say that bitch is a slur too? According to MW it is ""used as a generalized term of abuse and disparagement for a woman"" but of course when we call one of our friends a bitch that isn't what we mean. Same with mommyfugger, if you really broke it down then the definition is really a noun+verb used to describe a person who fucks their mother and a few decades ago it was a common slur to call people in the south which was backthen stereotyped as a place where a lot of people had incestual relations with their family members. Nowadays it's one of the most popular insults in the US, and was just shortened to fugger which doesn't really mean anything nowadays.

Ah, I thought you were making a joke that the word kitten isn't a slur, not c unt. A slur is simply a word that is ""intended to insult someone or injure someone's reputation"", so it certainly qualifies as a slur and not an insult. It's not a racially charged slur though, but that doesn't make it any better than a racial slur. In fact, in America, it's a sex/gender slur, as in a slur aimed at targetting one of the sexes. In this case, it's females. Merriam-Webster says that in the US it's ""used as an offensive way to refer to a woman"". So it's just as targetting as a racial slur in the sense that it targets an entire sex instead of skin color. In the UK we use it more casually like in Australia, but that doesn't change what it means in the US.

You said that ""if you don't act like white trash you won't be called white trash"" and your version of white trash revolves around someone acting trashy.

It wasn't too slow but it wasn't very entertaining. After watching this episode, it made me iffy about my rating of an eight. If the next episode doesn't end too well, I'm most likely going to lower it to a seven.

On the good side of things, Maria was found and Katarina was able to wake up from the sleep spell that Sirius put on her. I don't think we get the name of who the girl was that reincarnated into Katarina, so I'll just continue to call her Katerina. I completely forgot that Sophia was ""Acchan"", the girl who was best friends with the girl that reincarnated into Katarina.

Why I thought this episode was fair is because while under the sleep spell, Katarina remembers her past life. That's not the bad part. I disliked how Sophia's past life, Acchan, was able to freely think and assist Katarina. If it was a dream, how would she be able to help out Katarina as she did? Ah, it's hard to put into words, but if you were able to understand what I said, it makes total sense.

5098,59916380,6064278,"A cute little anime with a cute ending to it. At first, I was going to give this anime a final rating of six, but I decided to keep it at a seven. It really comes down to your preference. I know a majority of you on HF wouldn't like this anime and would find it boring. With that being said, if you have an open mind I'd say give this a shot. It's nothing special. It's very average, but it's a good time waster and I'm sure if you binge-watch it rather than wait a week for every new episode like I did, it might be more enjoyable to watch.

We see Arte return to Florence. I think that was the best choice she could make. Not only because she missed Leo and she wanted to be with him, but because she knew that she needed more training to become an even greater painter than she is. Despite being offered a job that no one else would be able to get, she ends up declining it. I respect that.

The artwork in terms of the animation and the characters were average as you hear me say often. Nothing special. Stuff you see typically. The characters, other than Arte, were boring and really lacked any type of individuality.

In terms of the artwork that was painted, it was okay too. Nothing really wowed me, but I do like the effort put into creating the artwork of that time.

If you aren't into art then no of course you wouldn't like this anime. I wanted to give this anime a shot. I was curious when I read about it during the first week of its airing. After watching the first episode, it turned out better than I thought.

There is bit of comedy in here. You'll find yourself laughing at times, mostly due to Arte being a goofball.

One complaint I had was the constant annoyance of bringing up feminist stuff. Over time, they stopped shoving it in our face, but maybe for the first 5-6 episodes you'll hear ""omg girls can't be doing this"" ""omg you can't be serious you're a girl painting"". It's very annoying.",0,0
5099,59885363,6060099,"One more episode left in Tamayomi. The match isn't too exciting, the animation at times is still wonky, and the CGI is ugly as usual. I don't think the ending will be anything special but anything could happen at this point.

The end of the episode leaves us with a cliffhanger as the other team gets a home run, advancing their lead by two points now.

Let's see if the Tamayomi girls have what it takes to win the game. Considering the very first game we got a preview of the match we are currently watching, I think they'll end up catching up.",0,0
5100,59874524,6064278,"With two more episodes left, I'm wondering what the director will leave us with. Getting into the discussion of the 10th episode, it was a typical episode with nothing special to it. We continue seeing the relationship between Katarina and Arte grow.

Arte can influence people in ways they never thought before. In the period that they are, which is the renaissance, I don't think too many women voiced their opinions or talked back to their spouses. We discussed in previous posts that women don't have too much to them other than being caretakers at home and such.

Arte can defy this and she's doing a good job influencing other women to stand up for themselves too. At times this anime had some feminist influence on it. It wasn't necessarily forced, but at times it could get repetitive. The directors have been doing a good job of controlling how much they include in an episode because I know for a fact that many people in the MAL discussion posts were annoyed by it.

Anyways, that's not the main my main focus of this post. All I can say is that Arte is influential and even though she is a woman, she's proving everyone that anyone regardless of their gender or social status can do whatever they want if they put in the effort.

I'll admit the past few episodes since her arrival to Venice have been boring and I hope the remaining two episodes give us something to remember this anime by, but I don't think it will. At the very least, I'd like the remaining two episodes to be enjoyable.",0,0
5101,59891597,6060105,"If you've been keeping up with Listeners, then you know this show isn't anything special. Getting into the discussion of episode 11, I would say I was wrong but technically I wasn't. In the last discussion post, I wasn't sure whether or no the group of earless were called Listeners or if Mu's real name was that. It turns out, the earless are still earless, but Listeners is Mu's real name.

This episode, Mu finally tries to take over the world where we left off from the previous episode. This anime is very confusing as I may have mentioned before. If I didn't well, it is. We are getting scenes of different people we've met throughout this anime, such as Echo's sister in Liverchester, people in Londinium such as Nir, and so on so forth. 

Why I'm confused is while we are getting these scenes in the current time of these people witnessing the earless roaming free causing terror, somehow Mu just randomly teleports to Liverchester. Why is she even there? I'm assuming because that's where the ""first concert"" destroying the earless was held?

As I mentioned (maybe I'm not even sure at this point - I'm half asleep while writing this) in my previous discussion post, I predicted that all the big named players will band together to try and take down Mu. Previously, we saw Echo I guess looking for himself. Trying to figure out who he really is. We see that he turns himself into a player and I believe he is the only one who can really stop Mu.

I am upset with this episode. I know that Echo wasn't originally there when Denka and everyone who met together to form a group to stop Mu, but I figured he would eventually make his way to Liverchester to stop Mu from what she is doing. Why I am upset is because his entrance was so lame. He didn't even have an entrance! He just appeared out of nowhere. No visual, no sound. I was expecting an explosive appearance. Maybe him screaming out of nowhere and helping Nir and Bilin. But nope, he just appears out of nowhere like he came out of the ground or he was walking. LAME.

In the preview for the next and final episode, I feel like they showed off too much, but maybe they didn't. I already know (making a prediction) that Echo is going to do something to stop the earless and either destroy Mu himself or convince her to turn back to the girl that everyone remembers.

5102,59867256,6060105,"Somewhat of a confusing episode. I went over to the episode 10 discussion on MAL to figure out what I wanted to talk about this discussion post, but it looks like everyone else was confused too!

Only a few things I want to talk about. We find out that Mu isn't Jimi's sister, but Janis, the girl we ""meet"" in this episode. I put quotes around meet because she passed away years ago and I'm guessing Echo was seeing some sort of mirage or vision.

In the ending segment of the anime, we also learn that Mu is the King of the Earless and I'm not sure if her name is listeners or if that is the real name of the earless. Anyways, although this show hasn't been too interesting up until this point, it looks like we'll be getting some drama in the remaining episodes.

From what I can see in the ending preview after the ending segment is that everyone is going to band together (all of the major players we've met) and somehow Echo is going to do something that will either kill Mu or change her back to to the ""sweetheart"" we all know. However, it could end either way! Honestly, after learning that she is ""evil"", I couldn't care less what happened to her.

5103,59910690,6060101,"We finally get to the last episode of Kakushigoto. One of my favorite anime that aired this spring 2020 season. I would say it's in my top three.

We learn what happens to Gotou-sensei when we fast-forward to when Hime is 18. He was in an accident that caused him to be in a coma for a long time. I'm not sure how long he was in it, but he was definitely out for a while.

We also learn some history of his downfall as a manga artist and we even learn that Hime has a brother. The ending was really good and it hit the feels the most out of all the episodes. If you enjoyed watching this series, then this episode will definitely hit you in the feels as it hit me!

The characters weren't anything special. However, with this type of anime, I don't think that matters too much. The voice acting was fairly good and I had no complaints regarding it. There were some funny characters. They even had some famous seiyuu like Ayane Sakura (one of my favs), Takahashi Rie (my absolute favorite female seiyuu), Maaya Uchida (known for characters like Rikka Takanashi from Chuunibyou) and Rikako Aida from Love Live! Sunshine!!

While there was really no set plot for each episode, it panned out very well. The goal of each episode was to see Gotou's progress on his manga and then see him go home to Hime and live his life with her while trying to keep his life as a mangaka a secret. While my explanation of this anime isn't that great, I do recommend watching it. It has a funny side, and a feelsy side os if you are looking for a comedic slice-of-life anime you might enjoy this. Your rating might be a little lower than mine, but I ended up giving this one an eight, which is ""Very good"".

There are two more episodes left in this amazing anime. The next two episodes are most likely going to be on the more ""feelsy"" side I think. We learn through the ending credits in episode 10 that eventually Goto will be quitting as a mangaka.

It was brought up that he believes he wasn't able to make anyone laugh anymore and his time was over. Additionally, it turns out that information about him was leaked to the public. Being a ""gag artist"" this tarnishes the reputation of the person behind the gag, as well as the whole gag in general.

If you take a look at the two pictures below which were screenshotted from the ending preview, you'll see a girl (who is circled in red) that has a similar ""facial and hairstyle"" of Hime's mother.
   
   

I'm guessing in the news article, it explains that she was lost at sea and her husband was a mangaka?

Anyways, if it is Hime's mother, we know what happened to her and how she passed. Additionally, I didn't mention it before, but we still don't know if Goto passes away. All we know is that his work as a mangaka ends, but we don't know if he passes away or not.",0,0
5105,59898153,6060109,"A rather boring episode. Not much action. Mostly talking and the talking in the anime did add to the story, but it wasn't anything crazy.

We learn that the first person to talk to the alien and make a wish was a girl named Honoka. She shows a picture of her friends to the alien saying that she'll ask her friends to assist the alien in finding the coins.

It sounds like love at first sight but it isn't hinted whether or not the two were attracted to each other. From what it sounds like through dialogue, either they were attracted, or in some way or another, Alien had some sort of influence from her. You can be influenced by someone of the other gender and not have feelings other more than being friends. Does that make sense? I tried to word that as best as possible without sounding dumb, but I for sure sound dumb lol.

Included in the picture are either Elena or Sayaka. I'm going more towards Elena because that would make more sense. Additionally, Sayaka and Shuichi never met before the mountain so that probably checks her off the list. The reason why I even mentioned her is that Shuichi lost his memory regarding why he became the dog costume monster thing.

This Honoka girl can most likely lead us to the path of the lost memories. I think that Shuichi, Claire, and Elena are eventually going to team up. I am not sure how well that is going to be though but I believe at one point they will become a team.

Shuichi learns through one of the members of the gang that they were running away from in the forest, that Madoka, the big ape guy, and leader of that gang died trying to help save the people trapped in the burning forest. Additionally, everyone else died except for one guy. He isn't important enough to have a name or if he does have a name I forgot it. Anyways, they talk, blah blah, very boring, they fight, terrible fight, unknown name guy dies. Poorly done fight.

At the end of the episode, we meet a new character that we saw in one of the pictures. He is accompanied by Honoka who has great power and can kill people with one single swing of her sword. That fight was so boring and awful. Just poorly done.

Spoiler  (Click to View)   Quote:CHICAGO -- Fourteen people, including five children, were killed as more than 100 people were shot in a wave of gunfire in Chicago over the Father's Day weekend that produced the city's highest number of shooting victims in a single weekend this year.

Among the victims was 3-year-old Mekhi James, who police said was fatally shot Saturday as the boy was in a car with his father in the south Austin neighborhood.

Police said the child's 27-year-old father was the intended target when someone fired shots at the vehicle, but he is not cooperating with detectives. Community leaders are offering a $10,000 reward for any information in the boy's killing.

After Mekhi's fatal shooting, longtime community activist Andrew Holmes said he had spoken to one of the boy's relatives, who said the child's mother is ""totally upset,"" the Chicago Tribune reported.

""She loved her baby,"" Holmes said, adding, ""This baby had a family.""

The weekend's other young shooting victims included a 13-year-old girl who died after being shot in the neck while watching TV in her home, and two boys, ages 17 and 16, killed in a separate shooting on Saturday.

Police Superintendent David Brown said police were working hard to track down those responsible for the violence in several Chicago communities. He said ""gangs, guns and drugs"" are the common thread in those shootings.

""Good men throughout this city should be celebrating with their families on a beautiful day, but instead, a number of Chicagoans will be spending Father's Day grieving the loss of their children,"" he said Sunday.

In all, 102 people were shot across Chicago from Friday evening to Monday morning - the highest number of shooting victims in a single weekend this year, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

The violence comes nearly a month after Chicago had its deadliest Memorial Day weekend since 2015 as nine people were killed and another 27 wounded in shootings.

I'm old school too but I'm old school bc I am old and I remember what TV was like way back before the Internet. You have to understand that TV used to be the barometer for social acceptability. If they allowed it on prime time or on a children's show, then it was considered benign. Back then, for better or worse, they would never allow anything that promoted LGBTQ as socially acceptable. Basically you couldn't encourage anything outside of man + woman + wedding vows.

So i recently became intrested in spamming but i find it hard to find information about this is what i know so far
Smtp: Mail transfer protocol used to send emails
Pop3 / Imap: This is for recieving mails and retrieving them as far as i know
I know a mailing program is needed to mass mail but the questions i have is
Why get your own smtp instead of using gmails one
How to spoof emails and provent them from being detected by google i think how google detects that a email like facebook@support.com is spoofed is because it's sent from a different ip but how come some people successfully spam then
These questions might seem stupid i know i have looked on the internet and stuff but these questions are hard to find an answer to
If anyone could point me to some sources or help me with any of these questions that would be glady appriciated

5126,59924084,6089694,"Hi everyone. Let me give you as much details as I can, about my idea.

 I've registered, short (3l), brandable domain name with Serbian ccTLD. 
There was already a business running at the given domain name and there is a Facebook page associated with it. 
The Facebook page has 125k likes, 438 reviews and close to 5 star rating. I don't own the page. 
That business was about selling phone masks. Simple, cheap with large quantity of people targeted. 


I'll list things, I'll likely do and likely won't do: 

Most likely, I won't be flipping the domain name / or build up a project and sell it.
Most likely, I'll be going after the same business niche the domain was used for. 
In case I don't go for the same business niche, I'd still like to have cheap, always in demand,  physical products listed.
In case I do go for the same business niche, I'll be contacting the owner, to buy off a Facebook page off him. 
I'll be contacting local, mainly female, Instagram influencers, who will do promotional posts, at absurdly cheap pricemark.  I've also befriended, local, semi-celebrities who'll be willing to do promotions of the brand.

This will be my primary project and I'll be treating it as such.

What I'm after: 
Currently, I'm looking to primary exchange ideas and lay out the plan, properly. 
After which, I'll hire a professional, to work on  branding. 
In the meanwhile,  I'll be working on the website, products and blog posts.


If you are willing to exchange the ideas and / or  get involved in the project, feel free to convo me.
If you wouldn't prefer using convo feature Hackforums offers, drop me your contact information, preferably Telegram.",0,0

Well how about that, someone who finally gets it. And yeah, some of us have an actual model we work with, so it doesn't really matter. And some of us are not from the shitty USA, so yeah... I, personally worked in 2 vape shops, a call center, and a few other shorter ones, and I can say that I'm applying what I've learned then into ewhoring, and what I am learinng now in ewhoring in other ventures and areas. And just the fact that maven whatever hasn't even addressed some of the points made on here with strong factual information proves he's just as much of a ""nice guy"" wanker as I thought. Even if you didn't get ewhored, you are quite familiar with the friend zone it seems. Hence the frustration

   
And thanks for your insight, but wanks have nothing to do with it. We are here to make money, from people stupid enough to give it. If I don't someone else will. Life sucks, or life can be great, people do different things, yet you are more annoyed by ewhores, rather than the shit that's going on around us. You accept that, you get ""employed"", and are part of a system not many of us are willing to be a part of again. 

And stories are just that. Stories. I put some out too, just so dumb idiots won't even attempt it. And guess what? They didn't. 

And if you are a real one, you will quickly realize that the best course is to make some money with a pack from here, and use that to pay a girl for an actual pack, so you also get her approval, and even get an onlyfans account out of it. Alternatively, get good with girls, and you won't even need to pay.

5134,60117813,6103717,"I used to E-Whore many years ago, it was much less saturated but brought in decent profit.  When I get to be like 16 or so, I even did something I would never advocate and blackmailed dudes going after girls <18.  I don't do that anymore and dont want to, but I have potential rite now to make some good money.

My girlfriend is 25, she looks young. She used to cam many years ago but the pics were mostly private and have faded and been lost into the internet.  I see people selling picture packs, where they do like only 10 customers and have some of them holding signs while doing weird things people may ask for to verify the girl is real.  If she mad a picture pack and sold it to only like X amt of people, but offered support for 6 months - 1 year where she would do reasonable request of verification, talking on the phone for a minuet or two, ect... Would that be profitable? I'm not looking to ewhore really and she's not trying to go out and hustle her pics.  But we both think if she did like, 75% pics common, 25% unique for 10 people or so, then offered what I said with doing request for verification- so ones that people would never think about and no way to be able to pull off with photoshop, would this bring in some profit?

How much would a set like this go for?

Would it be reasonable to do a set every 6 months-1 year, the time she offers the support for request of verification pics, to make new packs then and do a new set of 10 customers?  She could easily pass for 21-23, or even 19,20 sometimes to certain dudes.  She isn't camera shy but just doesn't want to deal with the onlyfans BS, camming or anything.  I talked to her about how I used to do ewhoring and how picture packs are sold to a limited number of people to avoid saturation, and some people make good money. 

I don't see many people offering something similar.  There's people offering unsaturated packs, with variety of pics that you can use photoshop for those times dudes request verification - but don't see any where they actually have the girl who will do a verification pic or certain pic time to time for the buyers.  And even do a video chat once in a blue moon for each customer, especially if they want it to verify.

If anyone has any input on to how much a pack like this, limited to 10-15 people with the 6-12 month support would bring in.  She's pretty good looking, she will even be the first to tell you she isn't the hottest you'd find out there- but most gotta agree she's like a solid 7.5/10 at the MINIMUM.

Amount of money you get depends on: your social engineering, quality of pack and quality traffic.

When you start all of it is shit so you want have much sales.

First you need a pack, Google ewhoring pack, join different forums and find something. Use that saturated pack until you get money money and know what you need so you can pay a camgirl to make you a pack.

Your social engineering will just improve with time. Or stay shit, can't do anything about it.

Now, traffic. Good traffic always requests investment, so you start with bad. Google dirty kik/snap and post your info. Kik has lowest of the low, all kind of degenerates. Pedos, old creeps, furries, Indians and sometimes even brits. But you still can make money. When you get extra cash buy numbers and go to dating websites.

How does the conversation goes? You can tell them you sell right away or wait until they ask for a nude. Don't spend a lot of time talking because you are only living creature in their life talking to them so they will talk forever without paying. After you said that you sell if they start asking million stupid questions (can you handle my 2 inch dick? Ever fugged your dad? Your body count?) They are time wasters.

On kik its that simple, google for lynx to send life pics.

Snap has better quality traffic, but you need to post stories daily and you need an app to send live pictures and videos so you look legit. Make one for free using Google and your extra chromosome.

Accept money as Amazon gift card/cashapp/PayPal. Make dummy PayPal using female name you buy verified one.

I can tell in greater details. How to post on snap ect., good places for traffic. Just don't buy shitty guides. They sell shovels to gold diggers, you will never get 500$+ A DAY VIDEO PROOF WILL MENTOR. Only people who sell guides make that much on idiots like you.

Are you using only VCW or a combination of verification photo pack + VCW ? VCW does still works nowadays but only if your visitor is convinced that you are a real and live otherwise they will ask you to do different things to prove that you are real, especially that you have no sound but you can prove that you are real by sending them different verification photos and the VCW is used only for a quick verification + live a ""show"", don't stick too much with VCW because sooner or later everyone will realize that it is a fake girl on screen. 
- By quick verification I mean: ""go live by having a black screen + uncover camera + smile or wave + a hand gesture + cover camera again"" - very easy. 
- Or many VCWs have the option of ""leave/return to room"" so you can ""go live with empty room loop  + return to room + smile or wave + do a hand gesture + cover camera with a hand""... I guess it looks pretty good for a quick preview (that you are live and real).",0,0

Are you in for the race, or the marathon? You can milk your prem members endlessly.

The Method:

If you intend on getting $100 from someone do it for $50 then get them to think this is ""too cheap""

I priced a dropbox for $30, gave a brief pitty backstory how I got banned, and I need motivation to do a story.

The guy was willing to pay $60 instead to ""support"" and join my pitty party seeing the value w what I offered.

You can see in the pic that this guy was telling me to know my worth, and I can tax double, so he paid it.

Once you get confirmation that they are willing to pay just talk super slutty like shit a normal girl wouldn't say.

The kind of shit that you wouldn't even want to say cause its so gay. basically pre sext them...heres the before/ after.

< Lazy when being in need of money
< Expecting money to be handed over like some candy

When i first started I used my own personal email with my name on it and you could easily find all my info with it and my own personal PayPal and literally nothing ever happened and I did it forever even got doxed and shit. My friend got scammed $200 online and called the cops and they basically said they don‚Äôt give a shit and hung up so I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll ever chase anyone down. 

But would it be possible to get reported and they can back check all the money you made and shit? I don‚Äôt think the feds would use so many resources to hunt down someone selling nudes for 20 dollars online but I have paranoia and I‚Äôm finally on the brink of getting my life back on track. 

Thinking of deleting everything and storing all my packs in a cloud for a few months but I really wanna make money and e whoring has become like my main hobby because I‚Äôm always bored and it‚Äôs so easy and monotonous for me now it‚Äôs basically like playing runescape or some shit so I just do it out of boredom now.",0,0
5161,60068644,6100072,"   - Every cam girl from any website will be interested working with you if you have something to offer them.
Do you have a tinder/instagram/twitter/snapchat or any similar account with at least 1000 fans/followers/subscribers ? If you do, than you can drive traffic to any cam girl you choose and she will be very happy to split any sale with you. If you have nothing to offer them, you will waste your time.. 
- Split the profit? Do not think fifty-fifty because it is not fair, she is doing the entire physical work while you just drive traffic to her , maybe 10% - 90%  or 20% - 80% is a good percentage. Without you she is already making money but of course she will never say NO if she can make more money with your help. Keep in mind that you can earn from many models, so even 10% is very good percentage for you if you have 5 models, do not be greedy. 
 -  Managing the process is the most difficult thing to do because it must be transparent to not appear any suspicion of fraud. You need a website where the clients can pay for a ""live show"" and all your real models must have admin access (or an equivalent power account) so in this way each girl can check each transaction and they will always know when someone paid. At the end of the day /week (or as you agree with her) you have to send to each girl her money. Nowadays does exist different payment processors that split the money and in this case the girl will get the money instantly. You will have BIG problems in case of charge back and refund because it is not nice to ask money back from the girl, this should be your expenses (your loss).

   Do not expect to legalized contract because it is not the case.
Instead of a ""good contract"" just focus on transparency... as long as the model is assured that you are not making any cheating in regard with money she will work with you but you will never know if a client referred by you paid directly to the girl :-) 
It is your duty to find a method with good transparency to not arise any kind of suspicion of cheating otherwise you will not last long in this business.",0,0

Obviously ewhoring with a real girl would be more effective because she could send you the pics/vids etc that you need. The benefit to her would be that literally all the work she has to do is take pictures, you're the one doing the hustling.

So my main question is how/where would you recruit a pretty enough girl for this? Like 18-22 or w/e as long as she looks young and pretty.

Also would you recommend splitting income w/ her, like 50/50 or what? or just paying her say $100 or whatever for a 1 time photo/video pack? I have to guess that a lot of hot young girls dont want to actually do the work and would be fine spending like 20 minutes taking pics and being paid for it.

I watch women post porn on twitter everyday and still get sales. It's not about traffic. It's about your skill, your mindset and what you sell.  

i mentioned in my OP that there is always money to be made but its nothing like it used to be, real girls will always make more money than fake ewhores thats obvious but even real girls arent making as much as they used to be, back in the day before snapchat premium and onlyfans took over there was only camgirls on chatrubate and similars, now every girl seem to have an onlyfans or wants to jump on the bandwagon, if you're on any instagram meme pages the chances are that you have seen how heavy those onlyfans are advertising and you can only see how disliked they get in the comments cause there are too many girls wanting piece of that cake.

 Quote:I agree with the GFE (girlfriend experience) works the best because that is how I started and the sugar daddies piled up. I have actually made more with that method but for a straight male...talking to dudes all day just wouldn't cut it.

yeah that was the best part of this cause once u get enough buyers it was pretty much running on autopilot all you had to do is keep in touch with them every now and then and generate passive income from the same people but these days it doesnt work anymore cause the sugar daddies grew to this by how many egirls they been talking to since this whole thing went mainstream and they are starting to realize that non of these girls wanna actually meet up and they just want money for their nudes, you might get them to pay twice but then they get over you once they know the meetup isnt happening lol",0,0

If that makes sense lol, it's just a simp thing I guess, and most guys enjoy tossing money to girls for no reason, purely just for the reason that they're getting company and they can cause they make money. 

If you aren't advertising anything relating to selling content on your story, that's another reason why you're not getting that many sales.

5179,60007367,6095909,"i have been doing snapchat ewhoring since 2017 and let me tell you, things has changed.
this isn't one of those ewhoring is dead thread cause ewhoring will never die, this is rather a discussion thread to how things are nowadays.

speaking from experience and i reckon alot of other memeber are facing the same issue im about to talk about, of course there will be always someone saying that they are making more money than ever and that your SE isnt good enough or your pack is saturated  ect and those people are usually either selling some shitty ebook or mentorship or are just trolling.

i run multiple aged snapchat accounts averaging 6k story views with different girls, the way i do it is that i dont even advertise that im selling nudes or premium this makes the account seems real and personal and would get me alot of story engagement.
being a fulltime ewhore i didnt mind spending alot of time talking to guys individually cause that way i would capitalize way more by sounding real and personal rather than doing what every other premium does, and it was working like a charm generating at least 300$ a day between returning costumers and new ones, when i first started all it would take is post a funny meme or a sexy booty pic to have a ton of story replies but lately no matter how sexy and engaging your story is the engagement is pretty low, people would still screenshot your stories and view them but no replies.

the way i see it is that ewhoring has been mainstream for a while now that most guys who has snapchat or instagram, twitter has been exposed to ewhores that they it has become a norm and lost that wow sexy factor. there is literally a ton of free porn online why would guys buy yours? buyers arent interested in porn as much as they are interested in the whole girlfriend experience, they buy cause they think they might have a chance at having a thing going.  for me advertising nudes selling alone or premium wasnt cutting it, you had to add that sexting and give them attention, thats what kept them coming but honestly even that isnt working anymore cause as i mentioned earlier most people who are old enough to buy has been exposed to ewhoring at some point and its become obvious that they are not getting anything out of it so they choose not to buy.

SE is important of course but you'll need unsaturated traffic source, instagram and other social media has been heavily spammed by these new onlyfan girls advertising everywhere that the platform will die soon in regards of getting sales, tinder is still good but its been hit hard lately and its only a matter of time before it dies. you can still get sales from saturated sources but you'll have to be extra creative to get people attention and im not sure if that will be worth it, sorry if the read was long but i felt like this should be disscussed",0,0

Great question, the best packs are the ones with the usual verification pics (may require a bit of editing sometimes), quite a good bunch of vids, and the content of those vids, and the same goes for pics as well. and lastly how they are organized is a huge deal. folders called, clothed, selfies, bath, before bath, after bath, etc you get it they are detailed.

free packs are usually scraped and most of the time not explicit from what I've seen. paid packs are the way to go. or just pay a girl IRL for the number of photos and vids you need ...the very expensive option... in which you need model release papers and you need at least 4 other people to verify the signing of the document as well.",0,0

And I didn‚Äôt get that sentence: ‚Äú (tinder is not and whoever says this is a barely functioning tard)‚Äú.

5216,59959893,6092418,"   
so you are using the same traffic source's as you have been since you started, other users are using the same traffic sources & are doing completely fine. 

there is only really a couple things i would be able to say from a marketing perspective 

whatever you are doing on those traffic sources isnt working like it used to*

if you are using a new pack, maybe the girl isnt cute enough (get a new pack)

if you are using the same pack maybe its been saturated (get a new pack)

maybe your girl is too hot and it causes guys to think its a catfish (get a new pack literally girls that are 7's with fat asses do the best for me that's all i have to say)

you come off as not a real girl and just a ""premium girl"" or a ""catfish"" in your traffic sources 

this could be due to the media content you are using or the bios you are using 

in terms of media real girls whole tinder profiles are not them in bikinis being whores, the are more subtle about it and have a couple selfies the occaisonal gym mirror booty pic and maybe a slutty Halloween outfit 

if its your bio 
1. dont say ""looking for sugar daddies"" ""i want to have sexc sex add my snapchat to buy my premium"" act like a noraml girl would 
2. get creative think of something to add scarcity to make them feel like if they dont add you on snapchat they will miss out ""might not be on here for long""
3. add your snapchat but act like you dont care ""if you want sc: xyze-whore""

and finally your old traffic sources might be shit and dried up now (tinder is not and whoever says this is a barely functioning tard)

could be your tinder accounts are getting banned to fast could be you expect to get 300 adds a day off of one tinder account without split testing everything possible 

hope this helps you and others (always be testing new traffic and different methods of pushing them to your snap from one source)",0,0

- get snapchat (create a girl username and bitmoji on snapcaht)
- boost the snapchat score so it doesnt look like you just created the account $15-50 depending on how high you want the score
- set up a tinder or a couple tinders on your phone or using an emulator (use your phone number or buy them )

- make more tinders

Even though the pack is completely private, in my opinion, its still kind of scamming. Your customer thinks you are a real girl, and might also be paying for her attention. Little does he know, he's not actually talking to a girl, but a man. You are delivering someone else photos.

If you ever been on cam with friends im sure you seen a prescription pill bottle in the background or maybe you take pills and you see that little sticker of the pharmacy full name address and other metadata on the pill bottle? Well what if I told you all you needed was someones first name or full name and a basic location and you can obtain there address and phone number and sometimes other info. Its possible and its easy. just requires the person to have taken a prescription slip in the past from there doctor and almost everyone has at least once in there lives. You simply have to call around popular pharmacies in there general city the most popular being a CVS in if the persons US, other countries will be a bit more tricky but generally the same. You just call and social engineer the pharmacist to lookup the targets records in there computer system and get the data given to you. This method is also a perfect way to confirm someones date of birth for example if a girl you been talking with online has been catfishing or lying to you in some way.",0,0

Very conservative. Never leave a flake of weed on the tray, tap out the cherry with the lighter after my hit, taking gravity bongs or just one big bong hit. Also, I pitched with some friends sometimes for big amounts. I roughly calculated $500 to be safe, but I smoked upwards of 1oz-1.5oz to the face a month, while sharing with gf/friends/family. I usually get good street stuff (which is like mid shelf dispensary stuff) and sometimes i'll just take my girl to the dispensary 10 mins away because she has her card. I know it's not the weed, and it's just that I get a high tolerance to any drug really fast.

Without a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles later puffing and puffing, he finally gives up. The same girl shows up for the next four days and the same thing happens. On the fifth day, he weighs himself and is delighted to find he has lost 5lbs as promised.

My funny story is a true one from my medschool days. So I had a viva exam once. The professor taking the exam was a really old lady. I was called into her office when it was my turn, I greeted her and took a seat. She started asking me questions. I had good prep and I used to be a decent student but god knows why I completely blanked out. She kept asking one question after another and I kept staring at her for a solid minute and say 'Mam I cant seem to remember the answer'. After about 5 questions, she looked at the lecturers in the room (who were her juniors) and told them 'WTH kinda student is this guy, he doesnt know shit! I have to go to the washroom, you people ask him some questions and take the rest of his exam but dont be too hopeful' and she walked out. So the lecturers ganged up on me and started sledging and I was able to keep my cool (I dunno why). They didnt ask me any questions related to the exam though, they just kept conversing about unrelated stuff (probably to get me to ease up). So the professor returned after doing her thing and sat at her desk again and Im sitting opposite to her. She asked me 'what is your name son?' and I introduced myself again. She started asking me basic questions, moved on to some intermediate and advanced stuff and after a few questions she said 'You are an awesome student, I dont know who came before you but that guy was a total idiot, I asked him so many questions and even tried giving him some hints to the answers but he couldnt utter a single word as an answer. Youve passed with flying colours, you can leave now'. So I left knowing that her short bout of amnesia had helped me pass.

He calls the company and orders their 5-day/10lbs program. The next day there's a knock at the door and there stands the most stunning, beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his life. She is wearing nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign around her neck that reads, ""If you catch me you can have me"".

Well, he's out the door after her like a shot. This girl is in excellent shape and he does his best, but no such luck. So for the next four days, the same routine happens with him gradually getting in better and better shape.

Much to his delight on the fifth day when he weighs himself, he discovers that he has lost another 10lbs as promised. He decides to go for broke and calls the company to order the 7-day/25 lbs program.

""Are you sure?"" asks the representative on the phone. ""This is our most rigorous program."" ""Absolutely,"" he replies, ""I haven't felt this good in years.""

The next day there's a knock at the door; and when he opens it he finds a huge muscular guy standing there wearing nothing but pink running shoes and a sign around his neck that reads, ""If I catch you, you are mine.""",0,0

Unless there is undeniable evidence he took part of a crime then he is innocent until proven guilty. Do you know what a judge would say if you if you made your whole case based on a photo of a neck massage?.

 Quote:The order came as the US Senate on Thursday unanimously voted to approve a bill banning federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued devices, amid threats from the White House to ban the company.

The video-sharing app has come under fire from US lawmakers and the Trump administration over national security concerns because ByteDance, a Chinese company, owns the technology. The company faces a deadline of 15 September either to sell its US operations to Microsoft or another US firm or face an outright ban.

Sources previously told Reuters that ByteDance executives valued all of TikTok at more than $50bn.

Under a Chinese law introduced in 2017, companies have an obligation to support and cooperate with the country‚Äôs national intelligence work.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm encouraged by the bipartisan support we have seen in this body to hold the Chinese Communist party accountable and that includes ... holding accountable those corporations who would just do China‚Äôs bidding,‚Äù Senator Josh Hawley, who sponsored the bill, said in a statement.

‚ÄúAnd, if I have anything to say about it, we won‚Äôt be stopping here,‚Äù the Republican senator added.

Last month, the House of Representatives voted to bar federal employees from downloading the app on government-issued devices as part of a proposal offered by the Republican Ken Buck.

A finalized version of the bill, combining the House and Senate versions, would need Donald Trump‚Äôs approval to become law.

When asked if the president favored the legislation, a White House official said: ‚ÄúWe support Congress‚Äô intent to protect government-issued devices against the privacy and security risks inherent in certain third-party applications.‚Äù

A TikTok spokeswoman said its growing US team had no higher priority than promoting a safe app experience that protected users‚Äô privacy.

On Wednesday, TikTok said it was working with experts from the US Department of Homeland Security to ‚Äúprotect against foreign influence‚Äù and fact-check potential misinformation about the election.

The company has increasingly emerged as a platform for political discourse and activism. Users recently said they helped inflate attendance expectations at Trump‚Äôs June rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Last year, the company said about 60% of its 26.5 million monthly active US users were aged 16 to 24.

Spoiler  (Click to View)  President Trump defended the white nationalists who protested in Charlottesville on Tuesday, saying they included ‚Äúsome very fine people,‚Äù while expressing sympathy for their demonstration against the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. It was a strikingly different message from the prepared statement he had delivered on Monday, and a reversion to his initial response over the weekend.

Speaking in the lobby of Trump Tower at what had been billed as a statement on infrastructure, a combative Trump defended his slowness to condemn white nationalists and neo-Nazis after the melee in central Virginia, which ended in the death of one woman and injuries to dozens of others, and compared the tearing down of Confederate monuments to the hypothetical removal of monuments to the Founding Fathers. He also said that counter-protesters deserve an equal amount of blame for the violence.

‚ÄúWhat about the alt-left that came charging at, as you say, at the alt-right?‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúDo they have any semblance of guilt?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve condemned neo-Nazis. I‚Äôve condemned many different groups. But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me,‚Äù he said.

Brian has a sit down with three models that The FEARLESS Man works with and asks them how they use sex signals ‚Äì subtle communication to show interest in a man.

Some of the things the models and Brtian talk about:
-Practical reasons women use sex signals and subtle
-Signs she‚Äôs NOT interested in you
-Why women are sometimes harsh when you ignore signs she‚Äôs not interested
-How women can tell from afar if they‚Äôre interested in you‚Ä¶and no, it‚Äôs not your looks
-What the models look for in men
-How women can pick up your confidence level instantly
-How long of a chance they‚Äôll give you to approach them after you make eye contact‚Ä¶and why

Learn more about how you can get access to the whole interview, plus 25 subtle signals that Yazz breaks down for you.

A lot of men get caught up on why women aren‚Äôt just more direct and why it has to be ‚Äúso complicated.‚Äù The thing is, subtle, non-verbal communication is actually happening all the time, in all your human interactions. It may not be as pronounced in some interactions, but it‚Äôs there and it does affect your connections and relationships. It‚Äôs just part of how humans (and, actually, many other species as well) communicate and relate to each other.

In terms of women and sex signals, interacting with these sex signals, non-verbal communication, and all the subtleties is a crucial part of the ‚Äúmating dance‚Äù for women.

You want women to show up for you looking their best, and you probably have personality traits you‚Äôre looking for too. Women put a lot of time, energy, and money into doing that.

‚ÄúLooking your best‚Äù as a man for women is more about showing your confidence, connection skills, and social and emotional intelligence. That‚Äôs what the dance of sex signals, non-verbal communication, and playing with subtleties is about, along with just being fun and part of the romantic fantasy, whether it‚Äôs for a one night stand or a lifelong relationship. Women want men who will play and dance with them in this way.

Women tend to have been playing with this emotional and relational subtleties a lot longer than men, so it‚Äôs a skill you may have to work on and develop. But the good news is that unlike physical beauty in a woman, becoming adept with sex signals is something you have complete control over.

And this sex signals, subtle dance can become something you really enjoy too. Have fun with it! It‚Äôs a crucial part of creating chemistry, seduction, and romance.

This is the bot from the video you're sharing which shows that it works. 

Here's two problems with what you're showing

1. Your bot is CLI based, not GUI, so why mislead buyers?
2. This bot is coded in C#, while the one you're selling is coded in Python.

Also I know you're saying the bot works, but try creating female accounts with the sms-activate or pva numbers, they will get banned instantly, and this I know because I asked the dev himself. Please keep these in mind and update the video of the bot in action.",0,0

I don't know, I feel bad for him. 400$ is quite a bit of pocket change, and even if I don't go through all the effort of actually trying some things, I can at least give him some pointer on the sniff and scratch test of what kind of ""methods"" are bullshit and what isn't. Obviously anyone claiming to have an account takeover would never offer it for a measly 400$.

Judging from his post history of needing an account from ""gfsdatabase.com"" and needing urgent hacking of various email and social networking services, I'd say he's trying to figure out if a girl he's dating is cheating on him, or has been cheating on him.

5348,60021194,6096943,"Hi,
I have started my Shopify store a week ago. I have imported various kinds of woman's fitness products and accessories, made some SEO optimization, got the prices and design almost right and then it all stopped making sense. I deleted all products because I couldn't see any point in this niche, orders counts aren't sky rocketing as some web pages are describing this niche's popularity. The problem is every page is listing different ""best selling"" niches and it is hard to tell which niche to choose.

This is my second Shopify store.
My question is, what tools and methods did you use to find your niche? How to see if niche is successful and it is the right one? How many times have you failed?

I personally go trough some web pages to scrape information about niche, go to Google Trends, check niche popularity there and last, I check order count and popularity on AliExpress.

For example, I would like to sell something like eco-friendly products or solar panels. Should I just go with it?
Also, I am curious in advertisement budget. I see some people investing couple thousands of dollars in Facebook ads and still end up in deficit. I have something between $50 and $100 to invest. 

I will welcome any recommendations like books, methods, strategies or basically anything else that worked for you.

5366,57347908,5862031,"hello,
i am part of an anonymous twitter role play community and there is someone there whom i want to infect with a keylogger, so i can reach his real identity (i will explain why at the end).

""long detail part""

here is what i can tell you about the situation:
the are 2 websites that u interact with to be part of the role play community, 
-Site A = asianfanfics (you get to select and register for a role play community there and get the linked to the main twitter account of that said community so you follow and other members follow you)
-Site B= basically twitter, you make a fake account with your fake identity and interact with the people.
 
the target is a guy who gets in multiple role play groups and pretend to fall in love with girls there with the ultimate goal of getting them to trust him and send him nudes, i found out about that once i checked his account on site A and found out he is registered to other groups, i checked his twitter accounts on those groups and found out he is in relationship with 4 girls in the same time and already asked 1 girl for her nudes then made them public to hurt her.
i told the girl who he is dating in our group about this but the guy said he is sharing his Site A account with a friend and his friend is the one on the other accounts, now i know this is a lie because he says exactly same words on all of his accounts + there is more.

now i want to keylogg him to be able to reach his real identity and prove he is the same person + be able to reach his location/facebook account etc.

""details end""


so what i can do to my target is get him to open links, i am assuming he uses windows pc + phone, i can use something like grabify link to find out exactly which.

i want to know where to look and if there is some 1 willing to help here.

thank you i appreciate it.",0,0

In my experience, these are timewasters. If they don't have a picture of themselves or haven't sent you a picture, tell them to do the same first to prove THEY are real.  Or just move on. You will make more sales without verifications  than you will with.  Just go back and look at this thread I did on a no verification sale.  And this was when I DIDN'T know what I was doing.

He was there because his country made him go there, his country had decided to go to war and he was a patriot 

How many lives has he saved? All these are from wikipedia

 Quote: His first long-range kill shot was taken during the initial invasion, when he shot a woman approaching a group of Marines with a hand grenade in her hand. As ordered, he opened fire, killing the woman before she could attack 

I will take that as a firegroup of marines (13 People)

 Quote:after he spotted an insurgent with a rocket launcher near a U.S. Army convoy at a range of 2,100 yards (1.9 km) 

1 Vehicle in a convoy = 4+ People + other damage from explosions 

From his book
 Quote:Each shot I took always had a purpose and saved a life 

So that is easily over 255 lives saved, whether they be american, iraqi or even Eskimos he has saved so many lives. If he had to take a life of someone who was trying to commit murder then it is justified

5387,57308105,5858118,"I've been arrested 4 times. Only two of which were on the spot arrests. The other two were ""Passive arrests"" (can't think of the real term for it) and I was simply arrested on paper and given unsecured bail for court purposes.

First one I was 12. My neighbor who was 16 at the time stole his moms car at like 2 o clock in the morning and picked me up to go for a cruise. We ended up driving through the projects and didn't realize we had our headlights off the whole time. A cop started following us and hit his lights. So we ended up flooring it don the street adjacent to mine and dumped the car into a row of parked cars at around 50-60mph. All the airbags deployed but we were both miraculously alright. So we jumped out and took off but we both inevitably got run down. A tow truck driver responding to the call caught me. All charges were dropped, I told them I thought he had his license and I was so young it just stuck. Didn't even have to make a court appearance. My father had to pick me up from the police department at 4 AM though and it sucked haha.

The most recent one is the only other one that is what most people would consider to be eventful and this ones a bit more of a doozy. Back in July of 2016 a very close friend of mine died in a horrific car accident, so myself and a bunch of my other friends all went on a really bad bender for awhile. One night after drinking two steel reserves and 5 bottles of yuengling lager, I proceeded to do half a gram of coke. I got bored at the party I was at so I ended up leaving and going over to another friends garage where I drank the rest of my 12 pack and did the other half of my gram of coke. All I remember is leaving his garage at like 5 Am and suddenly I remember being in the woods. As it turns out I blacked out on my way home and drove about two hours South almost all the way to Philly from where I live. The cops said I bumped some womans car on the highway, pulled over and just took off. When I came to I had no clue where I was. I didn't know where my truck was or how I got there. I found my way to the highway and just started walking trying to figure out where I was. Eventually a cop picked me up on the side of the road and arrested me saying I matched the description and so on and so fourth. I had the bag of coke on me in the station and everything they didn't bother searching me besides a simple pat down. Couldn't believe it. I actually managed to narrowly escape the DUI as they were looking for me for like 7 hours. They didn't get me until like 2:30 PM that day. 

I got charged with reckless driving, fleeing the scene of an accident and disorderly conduct. In addition to that, I received $2K in fines, I'm still on probation for which I'm serving two years and I lost my license for a year. Moral of the story here is this: Don't fuck around with drugs and alcohol if you're going to be on the road.     ",0,0

I wrote a couple messages with him to make sure I'm happy with what I'm getting.
Since it's really important to me to have pictures with the girl holding a blank piece of paper into the camera, I asked him out about that and he made sure that they get done and added into the pack. (As you can see by his post)

When that happened, I knew that this is a must-buy for me and I decided to buy Option 1 since you are still able to negotiate a price with him for custom photos when needed.


As for the pack, it is seperated into 4 folders: Clothed (288 files), Nudes (374 files), Verifications (19 files), Videos (49 files)

The pictures are all high quality, almost all pictures are self-shot by the girl herself and for me personally it meets all requirements I have perfectly.

5393,57307547,5855944,"Okay so. I received a vouch copy from OP and this will be 100% honest review.

I want to say that I am in no way associated with OP and my review is going to be absolutely genuine.

As for the previous vouches. I want to in no way sales trash or anything, but I have to point out the fact that the user  ‚ñ∑KORNIS   and his vouch is somehow associated with the fact that OP used his graphics services and the second user - no comments on that. Although it might seem rather strange because the user has an old account with small post activity, but that for sure does not mean anything and I don't want to blame anyone for anything.

Let's get to point shall we? The pack! The pack!

So I received the pack in a form of 4 folders - nudes, clothed, verification and videos.

Each of the pack indeed contains - 50 videos, some are short some are 6+ minutes, 20 verification pics, 375 nudes and 289 clothed pics.

About the pictures, they are mostly selfies, but there is one thing that I didn't like and that is - lot's of the pics do contain a watermark from an app the girl was using in order to prevent reverse searching (that's what op told me in our Skype conversation), the seller also told me that it will be fixed and I hope he does, because for this reason you can't really use them to e-whore kik, but you can use them for snapchat e-whoring(stickers).

I tried out the pictures for snap, and some of them work perfectly, some work less perfectly. 

The best thing about this pack are verification pics, and I also asked OP to get me another verification of my request (which I did get, also got a pic with my name written on paper.):
Spoiler  (Click to View)     

Tried some of the videos and they were not snapchat sized, but personally, I don't find that as an issue.

I think that the pack is good money potential for advanced users (but only if u get the kik verification thingy) then it has a huge earning potential.

I suggest OP to lower the price for the pack without additional image requests from the actual girl.

P.S The pack contains some pregnancy images which can be used for sure!

I give this pack 7/10 because I think it's a bit overpriced as of now, my review can change if OP changes some stuff around.

 Article from OP Wrote:Sean McDonnell, the 57-year-old charged in the case, apparently ordered his German Shepherd to have sex with a 43-year-old mother of four that he met in an online fetish chatroom, according to the Journal.

They met to perform the kinky act with the canine, but the woman died hours later from an attack similar to a reaction unleashed by a peanut allergy, according to the Irish Daily Star. 

She was probably allergic to dog semen >.>

I assume what happened is that this woman was finally confronting her fetish with dogs for the first time, unknowing that she was allergic, and then did it, and had a MAJOR allergic reaction leading to death from the dogs semen that had been inside of her all day(or night).",0,0

5430,57321709,5859332,"Let me just say this..Female here who just dealt with a boyfriend like this; I think I can give a slightly different perspective. A lot of (obviously men) here think it'd be ""ruining his life over porn"" and stuff like that. They don't think it's a big deal. As someone who literally a couple of DAYS ago caught my (EX) boyfriend of 4 months messaging rows of kik/tumblr/snap/etc girls, I wished someone had found me and told me sooner. In a relationship it is a big deal. (Through the messages it was starting to escalate to him trying to meet some of them in real life, so I broke it off even though he ""apparently"" didnt physically cheat. Also, I didn't even know what ewhoring was a couple of days ago so it's not like I was in the business.) What he was doing has absolutely destroyed me and my trust. The non-single men who are buying these pictures and flirting with girls online are complete garbage, and I wish all of them could be outed out and their poor girlfriends don't end up oblivious, stupid and trusting like me. They deserve to have their life ""ruined over porn,"" because stuff like this isn't just porn. If you told on him, YOU would not be ruining his family, HE would have ruined it from doing what he did. I understand your moral compass and I clearly empathize with it, and it's terrible. But at the same time...all of us are online pretending to be someone that we're not to make money. We're kinda doing terrible things ourselves. I wouldn't necessarily say it's as terrible as cheating, but I'm biased and maybe it's just a different kind of terrible but just as bad. I'm writing all of this because when you get into sketchy businesses like this, you can't really have the audacity to call out other people's actions. You can acknowledge on a personal level that something is morally wrong, but you also have to realize that so is what you're doing. And you still made money off of him. If you're going to be in shady businesses, you can't go around passing judgement. You'll most likely be safe in ewhoring, but in other shady things if you start snitching, it might come back to bite you in the ass. There's a point in these sorts of things where it's just not safe to become a snitch. Sounds a bit conspiratorial but nevertheless true. So I guess just keep that in mind and don't get into the habit if you get deeper into stuff like this.

tldr; Even as someone who is freshly dealing with the pain of a man like this myself, I wouldn't recommend telling simply from the hypocrisy of it. Snitching in shady businesses can become dangerous as well. I do understand why you'd want to tell though, I genuinely do.

As a woman who just had her heart broken though...if you do tell, PM me screenshots of the bastard getting what he deserves ;)",0,0

Just because she has a premium snapchat or is a camgirl/stripper/etc, it doesn't mean she knows how to advertise or to sell. That would be her reason for working with you.

5467,57280040,5855624,"Everyone fears ""saturation"" yet if you ask them why, they can't tell you. 

Why?

Because most people don't know what they are talking about or what they are doing. 

Before we even worry about saturation, let me ask you a question. 

If you were about to open a new store, would you want it alone on a major street or inside of a giant shopping mall?

Myself, I want to be in the shopping mall. I want the foot traffic. The chance to sell to someone that might not have been interested anyway until they say my store name or display. Now if I were alone on that street, I have to hope that people decide to stop and see what I have. They might not do that enough for me to make money. 

Now look at ewhoring. Years ago, it was unusual to encounter someone on social media that was willing to sell pictures and videos of themselves. So it came down to basic SE. Now, you have ewhores, porn stars, escorts, strippers and regular college girls selling on Kik, Snapchat, Instagram, Telegram and Twitter. Men are no longer surprised to see this. 

So now, you see a flood of ""sellers"".  

So what does that mean?

It means you have to get better. I'm not afraid to go on a saturated site like Kikfriender because most of the competition is bots and rotten ewhores. That's no competition at all. And there is new traffic every day. 

That's how you have to approach ""saturation"". Look at the site. What's the competition? Are you better than them? Can you out-think them? Can you out-work them?  That's how you're going to make money now. Not by looking for that magical ""unsaturated"" traffic site.

The demand for female attention is high. The supply of females is low. Ewhoring just takes advantage of that. 

If you look at any of the good traffic sources, you will find less than 5% of the users are actually real women. And at least 90% of them are ""working"" (strippers, escorts, findommes, etc). So when you show any of these guys the slightest bit of attention, they are on the hook.

5484,29459850,3154521," Quote:A cat strapped with contraband to help prisoners escape from a jail has been captured by authorities in Brazil.

The feline felon was held by officers after it tried to deliver mobile phones and tunnel digging tools to inmates at the prison in north east of the country.

The cat, trained to repeatedly deliver items, was discovered with the evidence strapped to its stomach.

""An agent saw the cat and went to look at it closely because something about it seemed wrong,"" Marcelo Avelino, the head of the prison guards' union, said.

The officer found a bag tied to the animal's body filled with saw blades and parts for concrete drilling and digging tunnels.

It also had a mobile phone with battery and charger, Mr Avelino said.

Officials confirmed that the cat had often been seen coming in and out of the Alagoas jail before the arrest.

Prison officer Luiz de Oliveira Souza said that prisoners had raised the cat and that their relatives would often take it home after visiting hours.

""We were very surprised by this new tactic of prisoners,"" who trained the animal so that it returned to the prison and even managed to carry materials, the agent said.

Alagoas state prisons spokeswoman Cinthya Moreno said that the cat was caught on New Year's Eve, at the prison in the city of Arapiraca.

According to the O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper, all of the prison's 263 inmates are suspects in the smuggling attempt.

However a jail representative added: ""It will be hard to discover who is responsible since the cat does not speak.""

5520,28774194,3087563," Quote:The scientific journal Personality and Individual Differences has recently published research on the average erect penis lengths of men around the world, and according to the study, the men of the Republic of Congo are the biggest at an average penis length of 18 cm.

The study ranked 113 nationalities.

British men were ranked 78th with an average length of 13.9 cm, and Americans were behind the Brits (and the Canadians, Spaniards, French, Australians and Russians,) at 12.9 cm.

By continent, African men were found to have the largest penises, while north-east Asians are the smallest.

Among European countries, the men of Iceland were deemed the biggest.

North Korean men fell short, with the average being 9.6 cm.

The research was carried out by Dr Richard Lynn, Emeritus Professor of Psychology at Ulster University.

Though the study may have peaked people‚Äôs interest, it‚Äôs raised many eyebrows too with critics claiming that the study is flawed, as he used some data from websites.

Although the recent survey plays directly into ethnic stereotypes, sexuality researchers Masters and Johnson explained that penis size really has no effect on female satisfaction, according to The Inquisitor.

The Telegraph reported that Professor of methodology at Holland‚Äôs Tilburg University Jelte Wicherts said: ‚ÄúThis is a brave paper in a controversial area but the data has no methodology.‚Äù

Medical Daily says penis size seems to be a bit of a preoccupation for men, causing a healthy industry that claims to have various methods of enlarging the male organ. There is a significant number of men who claim to have small penises but are in fact quite normally endowed, the report says.

It says penile enhancements can come with a host of complications and side effects. 
Here are a few of the average penis sizes by country in centimetres:

Republic of Congo, 18
Ecuador, 17.7
Ghana, 17.2
Colombia 17
Iceland 16.5
Italy 15.7
South Africa 15.2
Sweden 14.9
Greece 14.7
Germany 14.4
New Zealand 13.9
UK 13.9
Canada 13.9
Spain 13.9
France 13.4
Australia 13.2
Russia 13.2
USA 12.9
Ireland 12.7
Romania 12.7
China 10.9
India 10

5522,28790944,3089262," Quote:(CNN) -- A gunman is actively firing at the Clackamas Town Center mall in Clackamas, Oregon, authorities said Tuesday.

""Multiple victims"" have been shot, says Public Safety Director Steve Campbell of the city of Happy Valley.

The two-story mall is about 11 miles southeast of downtown Portland and is anchored with such stores as Sears, JC Penney and Macy's, according to its website. 

   

 Quote: (Reuters) - A gunman opened fire at an Oregon shopping mall outside of Portland on Tuesday and multiple people were believed to have been shot and wounded, authorities said.

The gunman remained at large at the Clackamas Town Center near the Portland suburb of Happy Valley, said Steve Campbell, spokesman for the city.

""There is an active shooter at the Clackamas Town Center,"" Campbell said.

The Oregonian newspaper reported on its website that two people had been killed by a man using a semiautomatic rifle who may have also been wearing body armor. The paper said the shooting occurred near the mall's food court.

A spokeswoman for the mall, which was placed on lock down, said she had no immediate information and directed calls to law enforcement. ",0,0

5525,57274392,5568194,"I contacted you a bit ago about coaching. I have a niche that I want to try that I thought of. It's a sub niche of women's clothing. I was planning on just focusing the whole site around the niche, but I read you recommend general stores. The up side of general stores is that I can target more products and more niches, but in my head I feel like just the niche would work better to come off as a women's brand.  

I've used Shopify for my main business so I know how to set that up and have done Facebook ads before a while back. Probably could use some more work on fb ads, but the just of what I learned was start with $5-10/day PPE to get an idea of the ad and niche, while also improving social proof of the post. Once you find a PPE performing well, duplicate that post and increase daily by small amounts as by increasing too much, you can throw off the targeting. Also make a WC, but don't know if I should start with a VC or a ATC. What do you recommend? My plan was for an ad was using a Twitter post (fake) by a popular celebrity. A very broad sentence about the niche, it's a very realistic statement a female celebrity would make. Do you know if that would get flagged by Facebook? If yes, I was planning on using it for IG shoutouts. 

Right now I'm just brainstorming as I'm still busy with moving to start. I'm still interested in coaching from you. I was thinking of starting this first and then coming to you for coaching with my results, what I can improve, etc.

 Quote:Authorities in Iran arrested four girls and women last week for posting videos of themselves dancing on Instagram. Only one of the girls, 17-year-old gymnast Maedeh Hojabri, has been identified. State TV in Iran aired her ‚Äúconfession‚Äù on Friday.

Instagram is one of the few Western social media sites not heavily blocked in Iran, and Hojabri posted about 300 photos and videos before her account was temporarily shut down. Her account appears to be back up as of this morning. Hojabri posted a new video just hours ago addressing her critics.

Hojabri, who reportedly has often spoken about gymnastics and parkour in her videos, was not wearing a hijab in the videos that got her into trouble, which is required by law for women in the authoritarian country.

As The Guardian reports, not much is known about Hojabri, but she‚Äôs become the face of a resistance movement against modesty laws for women in the Islamic country. A hashtag of her name, #ŸÖÿßÿ¶ÿØŸá_Ÿá⁄ò€åÿ±€å, has emerged. Another, which roughly translates to #dancing_isn‚Äôt_a_crime, has also become popular. Logically, most people reportedly suspect her ‚Äúconfession‚Äù on Friday was made under pressure from Iranian authorities.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt for attracting attention,‚Äù one of the arrested women said through tears in a broadcast on Friday, according to The Guardian. ‚ÄúI had some followers and these videos were for them. I did not have any intention to encourage others doing the same‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt work with a team, I received no training. I only do gymnastics.‚Äù

Some of the videos of Hojabri are still available online on both Instagram and Twitter and show her doing nothing that would be considered scandalous to even conservative American audiences.

Women in Iran have posted protest videos of themselves dancing on Instagram, and other protests against the country‚Äôs hijab laws have erupted in recent months. The hijab has been mandatory in Iran ever since the revolution in 1979.

As the BBC notes, six Iranian girls were given sentences of a year in prison and 91 lashes after they were convicted in 2014 of positing videos of themselves dancing to the Pharrell Williams song ‚ÄúHappy.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not clear what sentence Hojabri might face for her dancing videos but she has been reportedly released on bail along with the other three women. According to the Associated Press, Iranian authorities are considering blocking access to Instagram, but no final decision has been made. People in Iran typically get around government blocks of sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube by using VPNs.

5541,57315090,5858982," Quote:Tens of thousands of women gathered in Seoul on Saturday calling for a crackdown on spy cam pornography, in one of the country's biggest ever female-only protests.

Perpetrators film or photograph women with hidden cameras in public spaces.

Although distributing pornography is illegal in South Korea, the videos and pictures are shared widely online.

Organisers say women live in constant fear of being photographed or filmed without their knowledge.

Carrying placards and banners with messages like ""My life is not your porn"", the women were mostly teenagers or in their 20s - seen as the main victims of the hidden cameras.

""Those men who film such videos! Those who upload them! Those who watch them! All of them should be punished sternly!"" they chanted.

The women covered their faces with masks, hats and sunglasses as instructed by the organisers.

Demonstrators said around 55,000 women took part, although police put the figure at around 20,000.

The recent protests began after police arrested a 25-year-old woman in May for secretly photographing a male colleague who posed nude for university art students. She then shared the picture online.

Demonstrators believe police only acted so swiftly because it was a female perpetrator, and pointed to instances of police closing cases with female victims because they could not find the photographers or track them online, because they posted on foreign servers.

While the law mandates a maximum five-year prison term or 10 million won ($8,970; ¬£6,770) fine for creating sexual images, and a maximum seven year sentence and 30 million won ($26,900; ¬£20,200) fine for distributing them for profit, protesters say many receive far lighter punishments.

South Korea has struggled to contain a rise in the crime in recent years.

The number of hidden camera crimes rose from 1,100 in 2010 to more than 6,500 in 2017.

Since 2004, the country has mandated that all smart phones should make loud shutter noises when they take a photo or video to make people aware of their use.

But apps can be used to silence the noise, and perpetrators are also using miniature cameras hidden in walls, bags, shoes or toilets.

President Moon Jae-in said the crime had become ""part of daily life"".

Last week he reportedly told a cabinet meeting that offenders should ""suffer greater damage than the damage they inflict"", urging officials to look for stronger punishments such as notifying employers of any perpetrators on staff.

5549,57306594,5858177," Quote:A man and woman found unconscious in Wiltshire were exposed to Novichok - the same nerve agent that poisoned ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal, police say.

The couple, believed to be Charlie Rowley, 45, and Dawn Sturgess, 44, fell ill at a house in Amesbury on Saturday and remain in a critical condition.

Police say no-one else has presented with the same symptoms.

There was ""nothing in their background"" to suggest the pair were targeted, the Met Police said.

Home Secretary Sajid Javid has chaired a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee to discuss the developments.

Prime Minister Theresa May said her thoughts were with the victims and the government would provide every support to the community.

""The message from Salisbury is clear - it is very much open for business,"" she added.
What happened?

On Saturday, paramedics were called twice to a house in Muggleton Road in Amesbury - first at 11:00 BST after Ms Sturgess collapsed, then later the same day, after Mr Rowley also fell ill.

Wiltshire Police said it was initially thought the two patients had been using heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs.

In the early hours of Wednesday, police declared a ""major incident"" after revealing the couple had been exposed to an ""unknown substance"".

By late that evening, Scotland Yard said Novichok was to blame following analysis at the defence research facility at Porton Down, Wiltshire.

A 13-year-old North Texas girl was awoken in the night by a smoldering cell phone on the other side of her pillow, but the cell phone manufacturer says she did something they warn users about.  

Ariel Tolfree loves using her Samsung Galaxy S4.

‚ÄúIt's really like, nice and pretty,‚Äù said Tolfree. ‚ÄúIt's high tech.‚Äù

Every chance she gets, she texts her friends and gets on social media apps like Instagram and Twitter.

But during FOX 4‚Äôs visit with her, she had to borrow her dad's S3 phone, because her phone is burned so badly, it's barely recognizable.

‚ÄùThe whole phone melted,‚Äù said her dad, Thomas. ‚ÄúThe plastic, the glass. You can't even really tell that it was a phone.‚Äù

Tolfree says her phone slipped under her pillow as she fell asleep, and the smell of something burning woke her up in the night.

‚ÄúI didn't think much of it, so I went back to sleep, and then I woke up again and it was more prominent,‚Äù said Tolfree.

Her dad suspects the phone overheated, causing the battery to swell and start a fire.

The Tolfree family had seen FOX 4‚Äôs recent series of reports on swelling baby monitor batteries, which led to a nationwide recall.

The Tolfrees contacted Samsung, and then FOX 4.

‚ÄúWe have a reasonable expectation that the products we buy are going to be safe,‚Äù said Thomas.

A spokesperson for Samsung says their products are safe, and pointed out that the battery inside the phone was a replacement unit and not an original Samsung part.

Nevertheless, the company does agree there is a need for consumer education when it comes to rechargeable batteries. That‚Äôs exactly why they post a warning in their user guide, which specifically states covering one of their devices with bedding or other material could restrict airflow and cause a fire.

Tolfree and her dad, though, didn‚Äôt read that warning.

‚ÄúIf anything, they should put a big warning on it, like a cigarette label, if that‚Äôs the case,‚Äù said Thomas.

Tolfree says she doesn‚Äôt think people should sleep with their phones and instead, should put them on a nightstand.

The Samsung spokesperson said they take any instance of a battery fire very seriously.

They have requested the burned phone be sent to them so they can fully investigate.

FOX 4 will continue to follow up.

In the meantime, the phone, the bedding, the mattress and pillow will all be replaced by Samsung.

Lure you in with fun times, flashy lights, beautiful women, booze, the prospect of lots of money, it's all designed to get you to play your first hand of cards or spin your first slot.

Corey Curtis, who fathered the children with six women, has been behind on child support payments and was ordered by a judge on Monday to not have any more kids until he could pay for them.
Curtis owes nearly $100,000 in back child support and interest, according to Racine County prosecutors.
In sentencing the 44-year-old father Monday in Racine County Circuit Court for failing to pay support, Judge Tim Boyle lamented that he didn't have the authority to order sterilization for Curtis.
""Common sense dictates you shouldn't have kids you can't afford,"" the judge said.
Assistant District Attorney Rebecca Sommers told the judge he did have some authority regarding Curtis' reproduction rights. Sommers cited a 2001 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling upholding a judge's power to order a defendant, as a condition of probation, to not procreate again unless he can show he can financially support the child.
""I will make that a condition of the probation,"" Boyle said immediately, sentencing Curtis to three years' probation.
Defense attorney Robert Peterson argued the probation condition was not recommended in Curtis' pre-sentencing investigation report by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, The Journal Times reported.
Curtis told WDJT-TV he planned to comply with the condition.
""Judges, they make rulings,"" Curtis said, ""they make them kind of hastily. So, if that's what he feels one of my conditions should be then I'm going to abide by it.""
The July 2001 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling affirming the probation condition involved a case from Manitowoc County. David Oakley had been charged with seven counts of failing to support his nine children, the justices said that Oakley's constitutional right to procreate wasn't eliminated because he could still reproduce as long as he made child support payments.

I think the main thing we all need to remember is we're a community and there shouldn't be hate directed to members purely based on what hangs between their legs (or what doesn't hang).

All I'm saying is if I were a women who was skilled in hacking / computing and some fat anime virgin script kid tried to take the piss EVERY TIME I POSTED... I'd find it annoying.

I don't think it's happening on a large scale, I've just seen it a few times happen to a member that has a female name. The thing that annoys me (hear me out) is that the ""female"" member seems very high quality, but at least 6 users have dismissed her view / posts because she's a woman. I think this is backwards thinking and women have a lot to offer.

I think this statement is also misrepresenting the author statement. Ok, Show me where the author said we are responsible.

Also, Why can't we be responsible? Doesn't it technically speaking make the forum a better place, or the internet as you used that. Also, doesn't it stop someone from being an asshole and causing trouble out of no valid reason?

Let me rephrase what you said.

""You and I are not responsible for another 'mans' actions and should not jump to the aid of a forum to stop someone from 'being a troll on the internet'.""

yet, we actively criticize someone for being a troll on this forum and we give them ""neg rep"" as a result. in fact, it seems the neg rep is implying, we need to actually criticize wrong doings that is damaging to the community. Or maybe thats just me.",0,0

You say we should be able to attack others for no reason? Ok. Where did the OP argue against this? He was simply telling us to control ourselves and not do it because it lowers the quality of the forum. Which causes issues as this can lead to insults being thrown to each other, it can lead to problems with women feeling intimidated by these specific people. It lowers the quality of the forum, and its generally bigoted. But, I may be wrong. Show me how it doesn't cause issues. Also, you say it is dealt with when it is in violation of site policy, but, what would be the purpose of a rep being applied? Doesn't it allow people to see the quality of a person and as a result, it creates some sort of consequence for the person why still having the liberty of being able to post and change and gain a positive rep? 

""This here is exactly what I am talking about. Criticizing someone is and always should be allowed. Attacking, threatening and harassing others is not allowed already.""

But, it's about the person showing respect and not doing it regardless. And, even if it is not allowed, it can still be done. Rape may not be allowed, but it can still be done which is why we teach people to control themselves and that it is wrong. But by your logic, since it is not allowed, they don't need to be told it isn't bad? That is the point. The author is saying ""don't do it"". And thats it. He's not saying you must be banned or punished but simply not to do it. And that is a statement, I generally agree with, regardless, because that statement, is positive and is actually a good message to spread. He's not restricting my freedom.",0,0

woah just ignored hundreds of years of philosophical discourse in 2 lines.

The main distinction between gender and sex is that the former involves social traits and the later biological. The distinction is first made arguably by Simone de Beauvoir in her work, The Second Sex, where she stated: ""On ne na√Æt pas femme: on le devient"", or in English: One is not born, but rather becomes a woman (Butler, Judith. Sex and Gender in Simone de Beauvoir's Second Sex). Furthermore, to defend this as the correct understanding of the term, we can borrow from Wittgenstein who argued that language is not based on reference but rather usage: 
 Quote:For a large class of cases‚Äîthough not for all‚Äîin which we employ the word ""meaning"" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language. 
(Wittgenstein, Ludwig. Philosophical Investigations, ¬ß43.)
We must then understand that the usage of the word is what gives it meaning. From such and the fact that the term ""gender"" is used by many, including academics and intellectuals (see The Inexorable Rise of Gender and the Decline of Sex: Social Change in Academic Titles, 1945‚Äì2001 and the  WHO statement  ), to refer to the social role rather than biological distinctions, your argument is moot.",0,0

 Quote:What are your guys' thoughts on lying about sexual abuse/rape? 

Its only going to get worst from here, Feminist are to blame for all of it as their movement teaches young women to view men as 'predators' by default. 
The days of a young man 'going in' for a kiss during a date or hugging a girl without having them yell 'sexual harrassment' are OVER. 

I believe that a lot of these women whom are part of these groups aren't fighting for equality or women's rights, If anything they're wanting to take-on the Male role within society.
What pisses me off even more is how the laws and authority figures tend to side with these individual and whenever a punishment is incurred it is barely a slap on the wrist. 

My thoughts are that there needs to be some severe consequences for women who falsely accuse a man of rape but first we need to have a culture change,
As there are simply too many beta-males encouraging this behavior by caping for females and taking their words for it.

I will be generous enough after what you said, and how repped me, to tell you that I agree with that. In some cases, after mothers and fathers drag their innocent children across the peerless border, just for i.c.e to either separate them deport them back so they can try it again, seems like a fallacy. I understand where you are coming from. Our immigration policy needs work. That's why hard left Democrats need to stop their obstruction and enforce past immigration laws that have actually worked. The President recently proposed an immigration plan that provided amnesty for 1.8 million illegal immigrants that mostly included dreamers and women and children. Please keep in mind the amnesty bill he proposed covers all of the immigrants that have come over these past many years. This also includes Fleeing war-torn provinces like Eastern Ukraine. The separatist movement embroiling with Vladimir own ambitions of conquering was tearing the country apart. Thankfully it seems to be dying down now.

The odds of her having a miscarriage are pretty high, do you think it would be acceptable for her to have an abortion?


Personally, I still think she shouldn't have one. One could argue that even though the chances to miscarriage are high, it's not impossible for it not to miscarriage. Without being able to 100% determine whether or not it will miscarriage, I believe that it's no different than a regular abortion. Even with a 1% chance.

5668,57324152,5857747,"Ongaku Shoujo, translated to ""Music Girls"", is an interesting anime. At first I didn't think I was going to like it because the typical idol anime these days are lame, boring, and have nothing that's unique about them. I could honestly say that's what came to mind after watching the first episode. The girls are not unique at all, they are a little bland. However, I do have hopes that the girls will hopefully become more unique than the typical cute, good at singing idol girl.

EP 1  (Click to View)  
Just like in the popular idol anime, Love Live, there is yet another orange hair main character that either will be leading the group to success or has some sort of significance to the future of the group. With that being said, I had a feeling that Hanako one way or another would have to play a huge role in the group. However, after watching and seeing that she was originally part of the group, it's safe to say (despite her horrible singing) that she will be that savior of the group. Does the seiyuu who performs as her singing on purpose terribly on purpose? I'm actually curious to know if Hanako can actually sing or not, so I'm guessing we'll see that later on as she ""practices"" to become an idol. As the preview shows that she will become part of the group.

The anime has a hint of humor that I enjoyed. I'll take an anime that has idols and a little bit of humor in it. Comparing this anime to popular ones like Idolm@ster and Love Live, this has a long way to go to reach the top. However, we have only seen the first episode so I am not sure if they will come close to these popular anime or not and I am curious to find out!

If you are looking for a cute, ""best girl"" I'm sorry but none of the girls have really stood out to me. There are like three of them I think are cool and all, but so far there is nothing really special. I'm looking for that girl with a cool fashion sense or awesome dancing skills or an angelic voice. None of these girls have that yet.

And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.

There are more languages than English and Aramaic. You should try investigating them. ¬†Christ is a Greek title name which means Messiah in Hebrew, or 'Anointed' in English. Jesus (or, Jesu), is a Greek translation of the Hebrew name Jaheshua (Joshua), Jahoveh is the root of his name, Jehovah means ""I AM"". Which means that he is eternal and uncreated. Jah-shua means ""I AM ¬†(Jah) Saves"". We do not know if Hebrew had a J sound in 2000 years ago; modern Hebrew is a reconstruction: Hebrew was a dead language for centuries, no one spoke it. Modern Hebrew is influenced by Yiddish which was influenced by German. The Yiddish scholars who reconstructed the language were undoubtedly influenced by Yiddish and German on how the letter J should sound. Should it sound like an English Y or like an English J? We don't know. But we do know that Farsi, an ancient middle eastern language, has the English J sound in it. So for all we know, ancient Hebrews said Jesus like we say Joshua. To be clear ""Yeshua"" is just Joshua with a ""more correct"" spelling. ¬†(Joshua=Jesus).


Clearly, the bible does not make a big deal if the names are the same in each language. So why should we? 

Was he black? We just have to look at Abraham, who commanded Isaac to go back to his homeland to find a wife, Isaac who commanded Israel (Jacob) to go back to his homeland and find a wife. Where was the homeland? Ur.  Chaldeans from their art do NOT look like subsaharen Africans. To add to that: Abraham's cousin's name was Laban, which LITERALLY means ""White"". But, were they white like a Brit? Probably not. Because when Aaron, Moses brother, rebuked him for marrying a black Ethiopian woman, God then got mad at Aaron for judging Moses and fittingly mocked them by turning Aaron's sister Meriam white as snow (like a Brit, basically) with leprosy. So it's safe to assume that they were white people like we would call a Japanese person white, or a Mexican white. As in, light in color, not necessarily white like a brit (or ancient Greek, lol). Ancient Greeks are extinct, modern greeks ''sort of'' resemble ancient Greeks but clearly are not the same people anymore. So is the same with the Jewish tribes of Benjamin and Judah.

I like girls who have a positive outlook and a great personality like Haruka so I know she's already going to be a favorite. Not a fan of Narumi's bitchy attitude. Don't like those characters. Hoping she either lightens up eventually, otherwise, she's just going to be on my hated list the whole time watching this.

During the first ""match"", Kanata was absolutely useless. I'm assuming it has to do with her not wanting to play anymore. If she didn't wanna play, she didn't have to. Also, Narumi's logic on beach volleyball having two people and not one person can be an ace was kinda flawed since she did most of the work... I get the lesson she was trying to teach Haruka, but it was flawed.

Interesting in seeing what happens next episode. During the ending Kanata was at someone's shrine. Wondering if that was her mother? Assuming it was. Maybe Haruka doesn't know she passed away? I'm assuming her father too because his picture was there. His face was also blurred with the infamous white line, which means he probably has no major role in this anime.

Some of the things you've said I can tell you how you're wrong. The Earth's distance to the sun, is not because someone made it that way. The same way fish can't breathe air, we can't breathe water. We adapted to live under Earth's conditions. The moon, scientists say (my only option for argument here) was the aftermath of how the Earth was made. Two asteroids collided and merged together, with giant fragments being sent everywhere. Over time, those fragments became one, and then formed the moon, which is locked in orbit around the Earth. As for the creation of the Universe, I cannot say. I may aswell agree that someone made the Universe and the Big Bang.

Let me convince you to watch one of the most pivotal movies of the 21st Century. This movie basically has a boy named Gordo, who is moving away from home to be a animator. He moves to Hollywood and gets a job as a worker in a cheese factory to foot the bill while he is trying to get a foot in the door at an animation studio as his dream is to have a TV show based on his ""X-Ray Cat"".
           Gordo is a mentally challenged skateboarder, farmer, deer, scuba diver, backwardsman, doctor, investment banker and a butcher. He loves a girl in a wheelchair and he has an abusive father. He loves Horses and Elephants. 

Basically this movie is about finding your way while you deal with discrimination in the every day world. Tom Green brings the character Gordo to life in a role many would consider the next ""Forrest Gump"". This is an outstanding movie and I highly recommend it.

 Quote:A woman was jailed after admitting to performing sex acts on her dog, according to reports in the news media.

A St. Louis, Missouri woman pleaded guilty Monday to carrying out sexual acts with her dog and was sentenced to 120 days in jail.
Dana Kintz, 28, called police on March 12 to her home in the 4000 block of Russell Boulevard, claiming that her boyfriend Shawn Ingram, 37, has beaten and slapped her. Police said they found child pornography on cell phone images and also saw Kintz with Ingram engaged in sexual acts with the couple's dog.

Both were accused of having sex with an animal, a misdemeanor. Ingram was also charged with illegal possession of child pornography.

Authorities said there was sufficient evidence to indict Kintz as a willing participant, although she said Ingram had coerced her behavior and he brought a dog collar and mask during one incident.

St. Louis Circuit Court Judge Michael Stelzer allowed Kintz to deduct her 68 days she already spent in jail awaiting trial at sentencing. Prosecutors had requested a year in jail. Ingram‚Äôs case is still ongoing.

 Quote:A woman is behind bars after abusing her newborn baby in order to snap child abuse photos, according to police reports.

Brittany Lester, a 21-year-old stripper from Florida, is in jail for placing her baby in a variety of dangerous places inside her motel room and taking photos to send them through text messages to the baby's father.

Lester is accused of child abuse after she allegedly took her five-week-old son and placed him in the following locations in her motel room, according to police reports. She stripped her son down to his diaper and squeezed between him in between the mattress and the box spring, lying in a dresser drawer while crying, lying under the bed, sitting on the toilet and inside the trashcan upside down.

According to a crime reporting website, the father of the five-week-old, reported the photos to police. The 22-year-old man said he was no longer in a relationship with Lester, but the two had reportedly agreed to work together for the sake of the baby.
 
The man reported that Lester was angry with him after suspecting that he was involved with another woman. Shortly after leaving the motel where Lester and the baby were staying, he began receiving

disturbing text messages from her.

The police report states that Lester took 13 pictures of the baby, including the baby in the following situations: Lying in bed with a plastic bag over his head and lying partially underneath the air conditioning unit in the motel room.

Lester also abused her baby in full sight of her 3-year-old, because she suspected that her ex was seeing another woman.

Lester will spend a year in jail on charges of child abuse. The child was not physically injured during the abuse.

You have some great point which are hard to dispute because its true. You're right, the corporations are the ones giving out the orders, and the regular people just follow, however the regular people don't HAVE to follow. I don't see how half a million children dead in Iraq created a safe and stable country. In fact more Iraqis are dying today than ever did when Saddam was in power. Also, AL Qaeda took over Iraq. The soldiers left the civilians of that country to suffer and die in the hand of extremists. First they destroyed the infrastructure, then they left allowing terrorists to control the region. 

Also, it is fact that the police kill 8 times more Americans than terrorists do. That says a lot about the ""safe"" streets of USA. Majority of the police are trigger happy thugs in uniform. 
   

8 times more.... Remember those two cops who shot and fired at 2 women during the boston bombing? They shot and almost killed 2 innocent women because they were simply sitting in their car. The police didn't ask any question or nothing, and just shot. That's fucking stupid, and I don't support anyone that operates in such barbaric ways. 

Remember the WIKILeaks video that showed American soldiers brutally killing a crowd reporters because they had cameras? Then they shot and killed first responders who happened to have 2 children in the car. They shot and killed everyone including the children. What fucking cowards, I hope those ""brave"" soldiers shooting large ass rockets from their helicopter crash and burn OR they starve to death in the streets of their ""loving"" country. 

My dad served in the military for 8 years. I'm not hating every solider because like you said there are a lot of great soldiers as well, even Israeli soldiers..

I ended up turning into this outsider though, I became withdrawn from society friends would knock at my door and ask me if I would come out I would make up lies and tell them I was grounded when in reality I didn't want to leave the comfort of my computer.

As I grew older I began to learn about hacking and would even hack my friends and family, I started writing my own simple SMTP key loggers in visual basic and soon I pretty much knew about all my friends, their habits, and even their passwords and user accounts I would login to their MSN profiles and read their chats even sometimes they would be talking about me behind my back. 

Even to this day, I investigate my friends and colleagues wanting to know more about their lives that I otherwise wouldn't know had it been for the internet and their digital footprints.

I don't think to this day any of my current friends know about my double life, it's a pretty strange life I live sometimes I feel like I know exactly what a person is thinking or what their next word to come out of their mouth will be, somehow my antics over the years resulted in me being able to read people really well.

CONROE, Texas (AP) ‚Äî A Houston woman accused of offering to sell her 2-year-old daughter for sex at a cost of $1,200 has been sentenced to 40 years in prison.

Twenty-five-year-old Sarah Marie Peters was sentenced Thursday after pleading guilty to charges that include promotion of prostitution.

Authorities say undercover officers in Montgomery County, north of Houston, encountered Peters online on a social media site. They say she forwarded photos of young girls and asked if there was anyone who wanted ‚Äúto have fun‚Äù with her daughter.

Detectives watched Peters board a bus in Houston with her daughter to travel to Conroe, where she thought she was meeting a man who would pay for sex with the toddler.

She was arrested Feb. 22. Her daughter is the custody of state Child Protective Services.

 Quote:A man from northern China divorced and sued his wife earlier this year for being ugly. That‚Äôs not a joke. Neither is this: That man recently won the lawsuit. That man is Jian Feng and he said his issues with his wife‚Äôs looks only began after the couple‚Äôs daughter was born. Feng was appalled by the child‚Äôs appearance, calling her ‚Äúincredibly ugly‚Äù and saying she resembled neither one of her parents. With that being the case, Feng initially accused his wife of cheating. It was at that point that his wife, who has not been named, came forward, saying she had spent $100,000 on intense plastic surgeries to drastically change her appearance before she met Feng. She never told Feng about those surgeries. When Feng found out about the procedures, he filed the lawsuit. He said the woman convinced him to marry her under false pretenses. A judge agreed, awarding Feng $120,000.

Body-camera video shows Georgia police officers laughing as they use a coin-flip app to decide whether to detain a woman during a traffic stop in April.

The video obtained by WXIA-TV shows Roswell police Officer Courtney Brown asking Sarah Webb whether she knew how fast she was going. Webb apologizes, saying she was late for work, and Brown tells her to turn off the car and hand over her keys.

Brown then returns to her car to consult with fellow officers about whether to arrest Webb or just give her a ticket.

‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù one of the officers asks.

Brown says she didn‚Äôt record the actual speed at which Webb had been driving. She then can be heard saying, ‚ÄúHold on,‚Äù as she opens a coin-flip app on her phone.

Officer Kristee Wilson suggests that heads should mean arrest and tails should mean release. Brown agrees and flips the coin in the app.

‚ÄúThis is tails, right?‚Äù Wilson asks.

‚ÄúYeah, so release?‚Äù Brown responds.

But then Wilson suggests a police code for arrest, and the two can be heard laughing.

The officers decide to charge Webb with going too fast for conditions and reckless driving. Brown then arrests Webb, handcuffing her and putting her in the back of a patrol car.

Police Chief Rusty Grant did not immediately return an email on Friday seeking comment.

The television station reports that both officers are on administrative leave and the charges against Webb were dropped. Webb said she didn‚Äôt know that her fate had relied on a coin toss until the television station contacted her.

‚ÄúWow, these people put my freedom in the hands of a coin flip,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs disgusting.‚Äù

There is a new snuggle store in Japan, where customers pay women to sleep with them, just sleeping.

Soineya from Tokyo described it as a ""co-sleeping shop"" where customers who are tired can drop by with some money to get some sleep with a pretty girl.

The workshop aims to offer its customers ""simple comfort and definitive sleep next to someone"" without having sex.
It turns out that customers are willing to pay a high price for a nap and a hug.

Prices start at 3,000 yen or about $38 for 20 minutes. One hour costs 6000 yen or about $77, and customers who need some serious sleep can get 10 hours for 50,000 yen, or a whopping $640.
Soineya charges an additional fee for customers who want to choose which girl to bed, according to news media reports.

Optional extras include a pat on the head, eye to eye contact and foot massages and the price doubles if the client wants to give, not receive a massage.

I think in general that abortion is a murky moral topic. There isn't a straight right or wrong answer.

Abortion, in my own opinion, is best kept legal and widely available, not on moral grounds, but logistical reality grounds.

There will always be abortions, so long as there is social and economic hardship, there are health risks, or there are social costs like disconnection from your family or partner if you don't have an abortion. When abortion is banned, desperate women are forced into underground/black market abortion clinics, where they risk death, and have little support from their community and family. So it isn't necessarily always  'morally right' to ban abortions.

Ultimately it is up to the would be mother, whether she is prepared to risk her health, and if there is a 'moral choice', it couldn't be a wrong one to have an abortion in circumstances where your own life is put at risk, by not having one, by smaller or greater extent. It would also be medically unethical to force a mother to undergo something potentially life threatening.

The marketing bothers me the most of all because they're reaching children.

At that age they're very vulnerable and should not be exposed to the hard marketing that's going on.

Be open with my reply      

The reports seem bias funded by bias media. Mainstream Rep/Dem mentality is very tradition driven which is anti progressive. My take is if they are willing to fight then they can fight. It's your mind more than it is your body. These traditional schools are built for females and not the males, agree? The GPA and dropout rate vs the two genders proves it but likewise the point of mine is the military is just a bunch of males training males where the schools system seems more better for a female. Maybe if things was gender mixed with God/tradition/& whatever else out then... (Read my unpopular opinion below)

My Unpopular Opinion: 

Long answer: Imagine a world or society/culture where ""gender neutral"" is 100%. No gender roles at all. The school system indoctrinates the youth to fully believe that you can be whatever or whoever you want to be & that everything is okay because the golden role is a law & is embraced into everyone's hearts/minds. This is the place you go to & everyone is bi romantic and bi sexual. Maybe even some genetic manipulation to cure this chained down majority whom are straight (Regarding to our present time) and tend to think that is how things are meant to be (Between Man & Women) when rather it's their poor genetic configurations & primitive instincts which always leads us to some war to begin with.

Short answer: If everyone is Bi than society is fly",0,0

First off, to deny the fact that a black culture exists is to go against what black people overwhelmingly believe and that would by YOUR logic and YOUR definition make you ignorant or racist.

The FACT is that the black family/culture SURVIVED SLAVERY and then SURVIVED the JIM CROW years, but what it COULD NOT SURVIVE is the expansion of the welfare state and the enactment of leftist policies. There is no way around this.

FACT: Black families were much more prevalent in the 1920's than they are today.
FACT: Blacks had a lower unemployment rate than whites as late as the 1930's.

So why is it worse for black families and black culture now than it was back then? IF YOUR INTERPRETATION IS THAT ""OMG HE'S SAYING THAT BLACKS WERE BETTER OFF UNDER SLAVERY"", THEN YOU SIR ARE MENTALLY ILL AND HAVE ROOM TEMPERATURE IQ

It's definitely not because of those big bad white supremacists that Hillary's campaign tricked you lefties into believing exist on a massive scale when they are LITERALLY statistically irrelevant (you guys always need a boogieman). Or are we gonna blame white people for black men impregnating black females and leaving them to raise children by themselves?

You should read Thomas Sowell's Economic Facts and Fallacies but then again you might not like him because he could be a white supremacist (spoiler: he's black - but then again you guys come up with terms such as ""internalized oppression"" LMAO for those minorities that oppose your leftist views)

Since you probably don't read (judging by your lack of logic), I'll include a quick video of Thomas Sowell below:

 Quote:Fuyuzora Kogarashi has the ability to see supernatural, and has been possessed by ghosts since he was a kid. This has caused a lot of trouble in his life, but now he has learned to fight back against the evil spirits! Unfortunately, he's now also very poor, homeless, and hoping for a happier, more normal, high school life. In his search for housing, he's introduced to a very cheap boarding house called Yuragi Manor, which was formerly a popular hot springs inn. It's so cheap because the house is haunted by the spirit of a high school student whose corpse was found there.

Kogarashi doesn't think this is going to be a problem for him, and the rest of the house's tenants appear to be sexy women. While relaxing in the hot springs, though, he finds there is an issue with his ghost-banishing plan; Yuragi Manor's ghost is a 16-year-old girl named Yuna, who lives in his room. Kogarashi has no desire to hurt a ghost girl, and instead he ends up agreeing to help her to figure out her unfinished business. That way, she can move onto the afterlife before turning evil and falling into hell. Once it is clear that he is fine with Yuna, the other tenants reveal their own supernatural secrets‚Äîhis life in Yuragi Manor is going to be far from ordinary!

I would say it's more the European lifestyle that's being affected, not so much ""traditions."" For example, I read that in the UK, barriers had to be erected in parts of London to prevent terrorist attacks because there were so many jihadists mowing down people with trucks that they had to take action. As far as I know, the same thing has happened in Sweden and a few other European nations. Some more extreme examples could be that now you can't buy something as mundane as kitchen knives if you are under a certain age because knife crime is on the rise due to mass immigration. You could also get jailed just for posting something on the internet that a single person considers to be hateful, such as ""Islamophobic hate speech,"" even if what you're posting is simply critical of the religion's values, and not propagating hate in any way. This law, as some claim, is to help the migrants ""feel welcome"" in their new home. Not only does this go against the principle of free speech, it can also censor the opinions of those who disagree with it. Doesn't that seem like something out of 1984? It does to me. I once saw a video in which police officers were parading themselves around in a gay pride parade (which in my opinion should be forbidden, but if you want to discuss that, make another thread so we don't get too off topic in this one). My understanding of it was that they were volunteers from the police force that decided it would be perfectly fine to degrade themselves and their entire unit by putting on drag over their uniforms and flamboyantly parade themselves around. The main thing with this is, if Muslims hate gays so much, then why are you trying to force it down their throats? That doesn't seem like a way to make them feel welcome to me.

While racists, sexists, homophobes, criminals, and fascists aren't exclusive to Islamic culture, mass immigration is bringing more of them in, with an emphasis on sexists and homophobes. To be homophobic is part of the doctrine of the religion, and if you are not homophobic, you cannot call yourself a Muslim because you are not a follower of the Quran, in which God requires all homosexuals to be thrown off of tall buildings and stoned to death if they survive the fall. The same can be said with being sexist. The Quran teaches that women are inferior to men because they are female. In at least some Islamic countries, women cannot go out in public without a man accompanying them, and if caught, they will be punished harshly.",0,0
5840,57344542,5859711,"   
Pretty much all of them. European culture isn't compatible with the cultures of most of these migrants and refugees. For example, in Islam, polygamy is acceptable whereas it isn't in Europe. Women's rights are almost non-existent in most Islamic countries, whereas in Europe and other western countries, feminism has pretty much achieved its goal of equality between both genders. In Europe, LGBT people are generally accepted while they're thrown off of tall buildings in Islamic countries. If you mix two cultures that aren't compatible with each other, eventually they will start fighting. In this case, incompatible cultures are being mixed by European leaders letting too many migrants into their countries.

In London, rape rates are skyrocketing, although the police there apparently don't understand why.
   

The same thing is happening in Sweden.

Let's say you impregnate a woman who you dated a couple times but aren't really going to go far in the relationship.  She doesn't tell you she is pregnant.  She decides to have the baby without your knowledge.  One day you get a court order and your wages are being garnished because you're the father of the kid and she went to court for child payments.

I fully believe men should have more power when it comes to their children and decisions on abortion.  Women get full rights when it comes to both abortion and child custody/payments.  While men get shafted almost every time.

I'd conclude that I have personally thought about this before- but after thinking about it I realized I probably shouldn't be having intercourse with women I wouldn't have children with. Even so, taking the precautionary measures are necessary to prevent such situations from occurring. It doesn't always work, hence the first statement.

On the other hand, as someone said above, they can go and have an abortion without father even knowing it. A man has to split everything with a woman and pay alimony. What's up with that?

Omniscient is right.  The father's health is affected just as much as the mother.  Just the THOUGHT of some law excluding a parent from keeping their child alive blows all kinds of gaskets in my head.  I mean really, imagine someone told you they could kill your child and there's nothing you can do about it.  Your mind would turn to mashed potatoes and you'd lose it.  

A women who chooses to to abort a child will have some mental issues later on.  A father who wants, but isn't allowed to stop their child from being aborted will have much worse issues.

 Quote: I don't believe men should have more power over whether or not a woman keeps the child as it's a decision that primarily and drastically effects her alone. 

That is an absolutely lie. It does effect the man too.  Do you know how upset I would be if a child of mine was aborted?  It's immoral and I don't agree with abortion.  And you can't say it's about the womans health either because an abortion can be dangerous while child birth is natural.

I agree in the financial sense but not at all in the abortion sense.

I do agree that changes need to be made to the child-support system and if a man makes it vehemently clear that he is against the pregnancy and/or is no longer seeing the woman something should be done.

From your last paragraph I guess you'd also have to bring it back to the argument of ""when is it a baby?"". There's no real right answer here though I tend to lean towards the belief that it is a human baby when it begins to develop brainwaves. This coincidentally coincides with when it becomes incredibly dangerous to even perfrom an abortion without risking the woman's life so it appears to be a good gauge as to when abortions should be made illegal.",0,0

You were abused, and I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. I personally think issues winthin American society stem from single parent homes where the father is not present. In the US most women will quickly upgrade to the next male. Often dividing families up and financially raping even the most loving and successful males. Add the other percentage of males in the U.S of other descent often within the lower-middle to lower class and it is no surprise that many wind up dead or in jail. Then the final nail in the coffin are those few men who stay in the family that are nothing more than dickless beta cucks.

Men are under represented in the U.S and the growth of social media has only teetered society even further toward a lowered attention span, mob mentality (metoo, blm, whatever the fuck else is out there), and the constant and ever present spousal ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù that might as well go hand in hand with an upgrade to the latest iPhone.

 Quote:A 14-year-old North Korean schoolgirl who drowned in a flash flood while saving portraits of late rulers Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il has been given a posthumous award.

AFP reports that Han Hyon-Gyong died on June 11 trying to keep the plastic-wrapped portraits above the surface of floodwaters that engulfed her home in Sinhung county in the eastern province of South Hamkyong.

Seven others, including Han‚Äôs parents, her teacher and her youth league leaders have also received awards, according to Channel News Asia, which add that her school will be renamed after her.

It is not the first time that North Koreans have been reported as endangering their lives to save portraits of the Kim dynasty. The Daily Telegraph says that in 2007 the official, state-run Korean Central News Agency published a story about a farmer who lost his wife and child to a landslide, but managed to save the pictures.

Images of founding father Kim Il Sung and his son Jong Il are hung in homes, offices and public buildings across North Korea. They must be placed in the center of a wall that has no other adornments or pictures,

I try to say what happened to me

I met a girl in November ... I met her first day of work on a camgirls site ... but from November to May we were together ... we talked for 6 or 7 hours a day on Skype. Known the son ... and many other things had to see each other and maybe I thought ...
.... in the last months I helped her and her son ...
until May when he had to renovate the house and to help it I sent about 5000 euros ...
after 10 days he wrote me telling me that it was over, that I had to disappear and not look for him anymore, I had to forget about her ... he thanked me and hoped that I was not angry .. and that he respected me as a man ..... she deleted herself from the camgirls site, closed Skype, e-mail, changed the phone number. ""
I sent the last 5000 on May 14th
May 22nd greets us
May 30th leaves for sochi
On June 10 he goes to live with his boss of sochi
June 20 sells home ....


A friend of hers when she left asked me 100 euros a week to give me information ...
I think it's a scam, I'm sure ... and I was stupid ...
of this person I know name and surname, date of birth, I know name and surname of parents and sisters, their profiles of vk (Russian Facebook)

5887,57384349,5865584,"Even though that question is quite vague and you will get a lot of shit from other users, I try to be a lady and answer your question.

So how do you get real people to ""follow"" you?
First of all you need an interesting topic, an idea or sometimes just a pretty face.
If you found that, you have to produce your content. Again, it could be everything and anything. Stuff about beauty, gaming, tutorials, ..... A lot of research helps to find out about your consumers, what they want, which topic they find interesting.
(for example: if you are into gaming, your followers will probably be mainly young boys/man; if you do beauty tip the targeting audience will be mostly women, ....)
Each targeting group has different ideals, things they want to see, and so on. So you need to study them and learn what they want and what they don't want.
All that is part of marketing and advertising your channel (there are plenty of tutorials out there; even some free ones).

That is just a really, really short overview how to get real followers. It will take a lot of work and time.
Of course there are always some shortcuts, but they will (most of the time) cost you.",0,0

Vaping is also bad.
What is in vape juice-
Water
Many ""vape juice"" flavors include good old H20. A reservoir for liquid and a heating element are the basic components of e-cigarette devices. A wicking material such as cotton pulls the liquid towards a metal coil, where heat turns it into droplets that are tiny enough to inhale.

Vegetable glycerin
You've probably consumed this sugar alcohol in food as a low-glycemic sweetener, a preservative, or a texture enhancer that boosts thickness. (It's also an ingredient in moisturizers.)

Propylene glycol
A tasteless, odorless, colorless alcohol used in antifreeze. Although it's considered safe for topical use and consumption, it's also an active ingredient in many fog-machine juices, which can act as allergens and cause eye and airway irritation. It can also cause headaches, dizziness, and drowsiness.

Flavoring
The names of e-cig flavors are amazing: Unicorn Milk; Krispy Krack Doughnut; Pony on Acid! Manufacturers usually don't reveal ingredients on the grounds that they're ""trade secrets"". Many assert that their flavorings are food-grade and safe.

Nicotine
In its inhaled particulate form, nicotine itself is pretty safe ‚Äì unless you're a child or a gestating foetus in a vaper. But in liquid form, even tiny amounts that are ingested or make contact with skin can induce vomiting, seizures and even death. Wear gloves when you refill.",0,0

You have prostitution and a dead man. You have the physical theft of his information (even though she just copied the info and didn't take the actual card). Ewhores aren't stealing information from buyers. 

Now you can make the claim of identity theft. But if you are using a custom pack, with the permission of the girl that made it, identity theft is out. You could argue fraud then. But you would need enough instances of fraud to make a case or a large enough amount of money made from one person. And then, you would need a guy mentally strong enough to go tell the authorities that he gave money to a person on a messaging app.  That doesn't happen often.

official charges are ""one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of access device fraud and aggravated identity theft.

5943,57361902,5710276,"You're in the audio engineering realm now. You'll probably need something more than Audacity. I'd recommend something that works well with VST plugins. 

The trick is to not rely too much on pitch shifting. The closer to how you get it on mic initially, the easier it will be to tune it. The EQ can be your friend along side pitch adjustments as pitch adjustment shifts the entire frequency where as with a good dynamic EQ you can pinpoint which frequencies.

Finally (well, probably not finally), if there's not much room sound, you can help mask any irregularities from the final product by recording just the general sound of a room with a tv on in the background or a fan going. This would distract the viewer's ears away. In this business, I imagine it's better to sound like a poor sound quality woman than a poor, poor man.

I'm guessing because you are located at the very end of the spectrum, that you believe that more is better. So in your world 7ft tall is better than 6 ft tall, and 200 pounds of pure muscle is better than 100 pounds, and of course 500 girls in 1 night is better than 5.

 Quote:A woman and three children were among the dead when the shells, apparently fired by Syrian government forces, hit Turkey's border town of Akcakale.

Ankara's response marks the first time it has fired into Syria during the 18-month-long unrest there.

Turkey also asked the UN Security Council to take ""necessary action"" to stop Syrian ""aggression"".

The request was made by Turkish envoy to the UN, Ertugrul Apakan, in a letter to the current president of the 15-member Council, Guatemalan ambassador Gert Rosenthal.

Meanwhile, Nato envoys held an urgent meeting in Brussels at the request of Turkey, who is a member of the military alliance.

The bloc issued a statement saying it ""continues to stand by Turkey and demands the immediate cessation of such aggressive acts against an ally, and urges the Syrian regime to put an end to flagrant violations of international law"".

The Nato ambassadors also expressed appreciation for Turkey's restraint in its response, the BBC's defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt reports.

At the same time, the government in Ankara is expected to ask the parliament on Thursday to authorise cross-border military operations in Syria, Turkish media report.

 Quote:He died twice in a rollover car accident.

The weight of the car crushed all of the ribs on his left side and punctured his lung, which shut down his other organs after it deflated. His heart stopped twice, medical professionals said. But that night April 29 was only the beginning of Pat McGuinness' misery.  

When his mind cleared of the haze of a drug-induced coma in mid-June, the single father discovered that he had lost his teaching job at the Clark County School District's Advanced Technologies Academy.

""And my arm was gone,"" he said, looking down to his left side. His arm was outside the window when the car rolled onto the driver's side. ""I know I can teach. I lost an arm. Big deal. I can think.""

McGuinness, a Clark County computer sciences teacher since 1998, discovered he had been fired when he went to the high school, near Rancho and Vegas drives, to pick up his course list. Assistant Principal James Burt, who had been temporarily promoted to principal because of a retirement, told the teacher to clear out his room, according to McGuinness. His license had expired, and he had been fired.

Attempts to reach Burt and school administration through the district's communications office were unsuccessful.

McGuinness, 51, knew he had until the end of the school year, on June 7, to renew his license. He, in fact, had all the completed license renewal documents in his glovebox at the time of the April accident, ready to turn in.

Since those documents never made it to the Nevada Department of Education, his license expired and the district terminated him, said district spokeswoman Amanda Fulkerson, noting that his license lapsed long before his accident.

McGuinness' license expired Sept. 1, 2011, months before the accident. But the state gives teachers until the end of the school year to renew, which often causes a ""stampede"" in May, said Jeanette Calkins, supervisor for teacher licensing in Northern and Southern Nevada.

And the department would have made an exception for McGuinness, if it only had known, she said Monday.

""My gosh, why didn't the school district contact us?"" Calkins said. ""We would have given an extension without question, absolutely.""

But the school principal never told the district's human resources department about McGuinness, Fulkerson said.

Before terminating McGuinness, human resources did ask the principal whether there were any special circumstances. The principal reporting nothing and didn't have information about McGuinness' whereabouts, Fulkerson said.

Teachers and students visited McGuinness in the hospital. They all knew.

Interested in seeing how the battle between Diablo and that Fallen commander turn out. I'm wondering if he'll defeat her either by killing her or just injuring her to the point she retreats. We haven't really seen Diablo kill anyone, just hurt them. So I don't think she'll die. I'm also hoping that once he's done over there, he'll make it back in time to help Rem.

An alternative to what I said is, Rem gets captured this episode, the Fallen retreat, and now it's Diablo and Shera's job to get her back before they awaken Krembsjafn whatever from inside Rem.

I've always enjoyed strong characters in MMO's, but sometimes it can be annoying when the bring that into anime. However, for me, this is spot on to the point where it's not too annoying.

Well I was wrong about Rem getting kidnapped, but I was right about Diabo coming to save her. It's strange that it's taking so long for his MP to regen and its weird that he even has MP. If his game turned into real life, he should be able to sleep it off and wake up refreshed, but I do guess that is what he is doing as he hasn't quested after for 10 days.

The star, which was unveiled in 2007, has been vandalized numerous times and completely destroyed twice. The most recent destruction came in late July when 24-year-old Austin Mikel Clay allegedly took a pickaxe to it. For his actions, he was booked on felony vandalism and jailed on $20,000 bail. He has since been released.

The council considered the removal of the star at a meeting on Monday evening.

 Quote:National City is getting a new groundbreaking superhero!

Transgender actress turned activist Nicole Maines (Royal Pains) is joining Supergirl as TV‚Äôs first transgender superhero in season 4, producers announced during the show‚Äôs San Diego Comic-Con 2018 panel Saturday.

Maines will play Nia Nal, the newest addition to CatCo‚Äôs reporting team who is fierce and driven to protect others. This season, Nia will follow a similar path as Kara/Supergirl that will lead her to eventually embracing her superhero destiny as Dreamer. Hopefully, the introduction of a new CatCo based character means this season will be spending a bit more time at CatCo, which diminished in importance in season 3 due to the fact that Kara was focused on being Supergirl.

‚ÄúShe has this ferocious drive to protect people and to fight against discrimination and hatred,‚Äù Maines told the audience during the panel. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the superhero we need right now.‚Äù

I'm from Belgium and looking for learning lot of stuffs about hacking and security.
I'm actually working as network administrator and it's not easy every day for a woman, I swear haha
This is probably why I try to surpass myself and show that is a job either for men or women ¬†    

The evolution of IT pushed me in this way. Security became something more and more vital, so
I decided to improve my skills and I hope that I will, by the way, improve my english :) 

Maybe one day I'll be able to learn you something ¬†    haha

I heard a lot about this board, and finally registered.
My interested are coding, especially greyhat stuff. So I like to learn a lot about coding keyloggers, RATs, crypters without actually using them on other people! (yes, that sounds like the usual ""for educational purposes only"" BS, but this time it is true. nice girls don't rat other people      ).

So far my experience is limited to html and VB. I am looking forward to extend that knowledge and being part of this community.

best regards
